The 2023 draft pangenome (Release 1) established the core approach and quantified large gains in structural‑variant (SV) discovery and small‑variant accuracy versus a linear reference. Release 2 (announced May 12, 2025) scaled to >200 samples with improved assembly accuracy and richer functional annotations, and Release 3 is planned for Summer 2026 with >350 assemblies. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))\n\n**How PacBio HiFi and ONT are used to build the human pangenome**\n1. **High‑accuracy, haplotype‑resolved assemblies**\n   - PacBio HiFi provides highly accurate long reads that support base‑level accuracy and robust assembly of diploid haplotypes; ONT ultra‑long reads span repeats and structurally complex regions, improving contiguity and structural correctness. The HPRC integrates HiFi, ONT, and proximity‑ligation data (Hi‑C/Omni‑C) to generate phased, near telomere‑to‑telomere assemblies with reduced error rates. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/release-timeline/?utm_source=openai))  \n2. **Graph‑based pangenome construction**\n   - Release 1 provides pangenomes built with multiple graph approaches (Minigraph, Minigraph‑Cactus, and PGGB), enabling both SV‑focused and base‑level representations of variation across haplotypes. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/data/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - The Minigraph‑Cactus method is a key pipeline for constructing pangenome graphs from multiple assemblies, supporting scalable, graph‑based representation of long‑read assemblies. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01793-w?utm_source=openai))  \n3. **Public data and annotations**\n   - Release 2 data include PacBio HiFi, ONT ultra‑long reads, PacBio Kinnex transcriptome data, and Omni‑C, with assemblies produced (notably) using Hifiasm and annotation layers added across samples. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/data/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**HPRC achievements and releases**\n1. **Release 1 (May 2023)**\n   - 47 phased, diploid assemblies (94 haplotypes) from diverse individuals. Assemblies were >99% complete and >99% accurate at structural and base‑pair levels. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Added ~119 Mb of euchromatic sequence and >1,100 gene duplications relative to GRCh38; ~90 Mb of new sequence came from structural variation. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Pangenome‑based analyses reduced small‑variant errors by ~34% and more than doubled detected SVs per haplotype compared with GRCh38 pipelines.

The 2023 draft pangenome (Release 1) established the core approach and quantified large gains in structural‑variant (SV) discovery and small‑variant accuracy versus a linear reference. Release 2 (announced May 12, 2025) scaled to >200 samples with improved assembly accuracy and richer functional annotations, and Release 3 is planned for Summer 2026 with >350 assemblies. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))\n\n**How PacBio HiFi and ONT are used to build the human pangenome**\n1. **High‑accuracy, haplotype‑resolved assemblies**\n   - PacBio HiFi provides highly accurate long reads that support base‑level accuracy and robust assembly of diploid haplotypes; ONT ultra‑long reads span repeats and structurally complex regions, improving contiguity and structural correctness. The HPRC integrates HiFi, ONT, and proximity‑ligation data (Hi‑C/Omni‑C) to generate phased, near telomere‑to‑telomere assemblies with reduced error rates. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/release-timeline/?utm_source=openai))  \n2. **Graph‑based pangenome construction**\n   - Release 1 provides pangenomes built with multiple graph approaches (Minigraph, Minigraph‑Cactus, and PGGB), enabling both SV‑focused and base‑level representations of variation across haplotypes. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/data/?utm_source=openai))  \n   - The Minigraph‑Cactus method is a key pipeline for constructing pangenome graphs from multiple assemblies, supporting scalable, graph‑based representation of long‑read assemblies. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01793-w?utm_source=openai))  \n3. **Public data and annotations**\n   - Release 2 data include PacBio HiFi, ONT ultra‑long reads, PacBio Kinnex transcriptome data, and Omni‑C, with assemblies produced (notably) using Hifiasm and annotation layers added across samples. ([humanpangenome.org](https://www.humanpangenome.org/data/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**HPRC achievements and releases**\n1. **Release 1 (May 2023)**\n   - 47 phased, diploid assemblies (94 haplotypes) from diverse individuals. Assemblies were >99% complete and >99% accurate at structural and base‑pair levels. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Added ~119 Mb of euchromatic sequence and >1,100 gene duplications relative to GRCh38; ~90 Mb of new sequence came from structural variation. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))  \n   - Pangenome‑based analyses reduced small‑variant errors by ~34% and more than doubled detected SVs per haplotype compared with GRCh38 pipelines. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x?utm_source=openai))  \n2. **Release 2 (announced May 12, 2025)**\n   - Expanded to >200 samples (>400 haplotypes), integrating improved assembly algorithms that combine HiFi, ONT, and Hi‑C/Omni‑C to increase contiguity and structural accuracy, plus additional polishing that reduces SNV/indel errors by more than half for most sequences.

([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06808-9?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Deconvolution for spot‑based platforms (Visium/Slide‑seq)**  \n   Spatial spots often contain multiple cells; deconvolution uses scRNA‑seq signatures to estimate cell‑type proportions per spot. Widely used methods include:  \n   - **RCTD** (robust decomposition) ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00830-w?utm_source=openai))  \n   - **cell2location** (Bayesian mapping of fine‑grained cell types) ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01139-4?utm_source=openai))  \n   - **DestVI** (continuous states within cell types) ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01272-8?utm_source=openai))  \n   - **Stereoscope** (probabilistic cell‑type mapping) ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01247-y?utm_source=openai))  \n\n3. **Cell‑level mapping and transcriptome imputation**  \n   For single‑cell imaging or higher‑resolution spatial data, scRNA‑seq can be mapped into tissue to impute missing genes and align cell states:  \n   - **Tangram** aligns sc/snRNA‑seq to spatial measurements (MERFISH, STARmap, Visium). ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01264-7?utm_source=openai))  \n   - **SpatialScope** and related generative methods infer transcriptome‑wide expression from spatial data using scRNA‑seq priors. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43629-w?utm_source=openai))  \n\n4. **3D and whole‑organ reconstruction**  \n   Serial sections are integrated with sc/snRNA‑seq references to build 3D atlases (registration, label transfer, and imputation across sections). Whole‑organ atlases increasingly combine **high‑resolution spatial** with **large sc/snRNA‑seq references** to achieve organ‑scale coverage.\n\n---\n\n**Examples of Whole‑Organ or Organ‑Scale Atlases Built by Spatial + sc/snRNA‑seq**\n\n1. **Whole mouse brain MERFISH atlas (BICCN)**  \n   MERFISH spatial mapping integrated with massive scRNA‑seq to define >5,000 clusters and spatial organization across the whole brain. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06808-9?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Whole mouse brain Stereo‑seq atlas (Neuron 2025)**  \n   Stereo‑seq + snRNA‑seq produced a single‑cell‑resolution spatial atlas of the entire brain. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627325001333?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Mouse organogenesis atlas (Stereo‑seq)**  \n   Stereo‑seq was used for large field‑of‑view, cellular‑resolution mapping of developing organs across embryogenesis. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422003993))\n\n4. **Regenerating zebrafish heart atlas**  \n   Stereo‑seq + scRNA‑seq integrated into an organ‑wide, spatiotemporal atlas of heart regeneration. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59070-0?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. **Whole‑embryo spatial mapping with Slide‑seq**  \n   Slide‑seq applied to whole embryos to build spatial maps of early organogenesis stages. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01435-6?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways for Atlas‑Building**\n\n1. **Imaging platforms (MERFISH/seqFISH+/Xenium/CosMx)** excel at **single‑cell spatial precision** and detecting targeted gene panels; they are often paired with scRNA‑seq to **impute missing genes** and to **transfer fine cell‑state labels**. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1049-y?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Sequencing‑based platforms (Visium HD/Stereo‑seq/Slide‑seqV2)** offer **transcriptome‑wide profiling** with high spatial resolution and large fields of view, but still require scRNA‑seq‑based **cell‑type deconvolution** or **cell mapping** to resolve cellular mixtures. ([bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-025-11235-3))\n\n3. **Whole‑organ atlases now routinely combine**:  \n   - large sc/snRNA‑seq references,  \n   - spatial data for localization,  \n   - and algorithmic mapping/deconvolution,  \n   yielding **cell‑type resolved spatial atlases** at organ scale. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06808-9?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also provide a **comparison matrix tailored to a specific organ** (brain, heart, kidney, tumor) or highlight **current best‑practice integration pipelines** with recommended software stacks.",

        "**Summarizing AlphaFold 3 improvements in protein-protein interactions**\n\n- AlphaFold 3 (AF3) advances PPI prediction by replacing AlphaFold 2’s (AF2) residue-frame structure module and heavy MSA reliance with a diffusion-based all-atom modeling approach and pairformer blocks, enabling unified modeling of proteins, nucleic acids, ligands, and ions.\n- AF3 trains on a broader dataset that includes PDB assemblies with non-protein components and uses a training cutoff of September 30, 2021, with filtered PDB data downloaded in January 2023.\n- Benchmarking shows AF3 improves interface accuracy, notably for antibody–antigen complexes, outperforming AF-Multimer v2.3 and serving as a baseline model in recent CASP15-CAPRI (2022) and CASP16-CAPRI (2024) assessments, though shallow MSAs remain a limitation.\n\n**Architectural Changes**\n\n- AF2 relies on Evoformer and a structure module operating with residue frames and torsions, heavily dependent on deep MSAs; accuracy declines for proteins with many heterotypic contacts or shallow MSAs.\n- AF3 replaces Evoformer with pairformer blocks that process single and pair representations without retaining MSA embeddings, uses fewer MSA blocks, and incorporates a multi-scale diffusion module that directly predicts raw atom coordinates without stereochemical loss corrections.\n- This architecture enables modeling of multi-chain complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions within one framework.\n\n**Training Data**\n\n- AF3’s training dataset includes PDB structures and templates filtered by release date up to September 30, 2021, with the PDB snapshot downloaded January 12, 2023, and chemical components dictionaries updated through October 2023.\n- Unlike AF2, which trained primarily on monomeric protein structures and relied on deep MSAs from UniRef and MGnify, AF3 explicitly incorporates multimeric assemblies and non-protein molecular partners.\n- Evaluation uses a recent PDB set of 8,856 complexes released between May 1, 2022, and January 12, 2023, filtered for low homology.\n\n**Benchmarks: CASP/CAPRI and Recent Evaluations**\n\n- AF3 shows improved DockQ metrics (>0.23) for protein–protein and protein–antibody interfaces on PDB and RNA-protein benchmarks compared to AF-Multimer v2.3.\n- CASP15-CAPRI Round 54 (2022) involved 37 targets including homodimers, heterodimers (antibody-antigen included), and large assemblies, with 40% high-quality models using AF2 and AF2-Multimer versus 8% two years earlier; limitations remained for flexible complexes and antibodies.\n- CASP16-CAPRI Rounds 57/58 (2024) included 34 targets and 47 assembly units; baselines encompassed ColabFold and AlphaFold3, with Round 58 utilizing MassiveFold models, indicating ongoing improvements though detailed peer-reviewed per-target analyses are pending.\n- AF3 demonstrates improved antibody-antigen modeling versus AF-Multimer v2.3, addressing a known weak spot in earlier benchmarks.\n\n**Interpretation for PPI Compared to AlphaFold 2**\n\n- AF3’s diffusion-based modeling and training on broader molecular complexes allow more accurate and unified interface predictions, particularly enhancing antibody-antigen and multi-component assemblies.\n- However, similar to AF-Multimer, AF3 maintains some dependence on MSA depth, with reduced accuracy for proteins characterized by shallow MSAs or complex heterotypic interactions.\n- The architectural shift to direct all-atom coordinate prediction reduces reliance on iterative residue-frame updates and realizes more chemically informed complex assembly predictions.\n\n**Sources**\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06113-5\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36760993/\nhttps://www.capri-docking.org/rounds_overview.html\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v2\n```"

            "text": "**Summary**  \nAlphaFold 3 (AF3) improves protein–protein interaction (PPI) prediction over AlphaFold 2 (AF2) primarily by replacing AF2’s residue‑frame structure module with an all‑atom diffusion generator and by simplifying the MSA‑heavy trunk into a pair‑centric architecture, while broadening training to multi‑component complexes (proteins plus nucleic acids, ligands, ions, modifications). These changes enable more direct modeling of interface geometry and heterogeneous chemistry, and AF3 reports higher PPI/antibody–antigen accuracy than AlphaFold‑Multimer v2.3 on recent PDB evaluations. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n\n**Architectural Changes That Matter for PPIs**  \n1. AF2 core: an Evoformer trunk that jointly updates MSA and pair representations, followed by a structure module that builds per‑residue rigid frames and side‑chain torsions; accuracy depends strongly on MSA depth and drops when heterotypic (inter‑chain) contacts dominate. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2))  \n2. AF3 trunk redesign: MSA processing is de‑emphasized and the Evoformer is replaced by a simpler “pairformer” that operates mainly on pair and single representations; the MSA representation is not retained, and the number of MSA blocks is reduced. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n3. AF3 structure generation: the AF2 structure module is replaced by a diffusion module that directly predicts raw atomic coordinates, enabling multi‑scale refinement and reducing the need for special‑casing chemical bonds—important for precise interface geometry across diverse complexes. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n\n**Training Data and Inputs (What’s New vs AF2)**  \n1. AF3 trains on PDB assemblies and templates while explicitly incorporating broader chemical components (via the Chemical Components Dictionary), enabling complexes that include non‑protein entities; training excludes structures released after 30 Sep 2021. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n2. AF3’s reported general‑purpose evaluation uses a “recent PDB” set of 8,856 complexes released between 1 May 2022 and 12 Jan 2023 (low‑homology filters applied), giving a modern, interface‑rich benchmark for PPI and antibody–antigen accuracy. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n3. AF3’s evaluation metrics for PPIs include DockQ‑based interface success (percentage DockQ > 0.23) for protein–protein and protein–antibody interfaces, aligning with CAPRI‑style assessment. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n\n**Benchmarks on Recent CASP/CAPRI Targets**  \n1. CASP15–CAPRI (Round 54; 2022 targets): 37 targets (14 homodimers, 3 homotrimers, 13 heterodimers including 3 antibody–antigen, 7 large assemblies). High‑quality models reached ~40% of targets vs ~8% two years earlier, largely attributed to broad use of AF2/AF2‑Multimer and their confidence metrics; antibody/nanobody and flexible complexes remained hard. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905971/))  \n2. CASP16–CAPRI (Rounds 57/58; 2024 targets): Round 57 had 34 targets and 47 assessment units. The CAPRI assessment explicitly lists baselines including ColabFold and a manual AlphaFold3 submission, and Round 58 evaluated MassiveFold‑augmented models on a subset, indicating AF3 is now a reference point in the most recent blind PPI evaluations. ([capri-docking.org](https://www.capri-docking.org/assessment/))  \n3. AF3 paper benchmarks: AF3 reports higher antibody–antigen accuracy than AlphaFold‑Multimer v2.3 and improved protein–protein interface success on the recent PDB set, using DockQ‑style interface success metrics. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n\n**What This Means for PPI Accuracy vs AF2**  \n1. AF2’s PPI predictions largely depend on co‑evolutionary signals from deep MSAs and struggle when inter‑chain contacts dominate or MSAs are shallow; this limitation is prominent in antibody‑antigen and flexible complexes seen in CASP/CAPRI. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2))  \n2. AF3 targets these gaps by shifting to a diffusion‑based, all‑atom interface generator and simplifying MSA reliance, while training on broader complex chemistries; this yields measurable gains over AF‑Multimer v2.3 on protein–protein and antibody–antigen interface benchmarks and positions AF3 as a baseline in CASP16‑CAPRI. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w))  \n\nIf you want, I can drill into specific CASP15/16 targets or pull the per‑target CAPRI score files and summarize where AF3‑based baselines succeed or fail.\n\n**Sources**\n```text\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37905971/\nhttps://www.capri-docking.org/assessment/\n```"

PROTACs and Targeted Degradation (mutant‑selective)**  \n- **R175H‑selective aptamer‑PROTAC (dp53m, 2024)**: A DNA aptamer binder was engineered and linked to a PROTAC, selectively degrading **p53‑R175H** via the ubiquitin‑proteasome system while sparing wild‑type p53; shows in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity and cisplatin sensitization. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927324003517))  \n- **Peptide‑based R175H PROTACs (2024)**: Peptide ligands for R175H coupled to VHL‑recruiting motifs induce degradation of p53‑R175H and reduce migration/invasion. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554460/))  \n- **Small‑molecule–induced Y220C degradation (2025)**: Cabozantinib disrupts **p53‑Y220C–USP7** interaction, enabling CHIP‑mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation with preferential activity in Y220C‑mutant cells. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39793887/))\n\n**2. Molecular Glues (2024)**  \n- **USP7‑engaging molecular glues (2024)**: Screening identified small molecules (including bromocriptine) that act as molecular glues to tether p53 to **USP7**, stabilizing p53 and suppressing tumor growth in xenografts. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927324002512))  \n  **Interpretation:** These are **p53‑stabilizing** glues rather than degraders. For GOF mutant p53, stabilization could be harmful unless combined with reactivation or engineered for mutant‑selective context; this is an inference based on GOF biology rather than a direct claim in the glue paper. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927324002512))\n\n**3. Allele‑Specific Reactivators / Refolders**  \n- **Rezatapopt (PC14586) for Y220C (Cancer Discovery 2025)**: Structural correction of Y220C restores DNA binding and wild‑type‑like transcriptional programs; preclinical activity and **registrational phase II** clinical evaluation reported. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39945593/))  \n- **Covalent fragment stabilizers (ACS PTS 2024)**: Covalent fragments (SN001/SN006/SN007) bind the Y220C pocket and stabilize the mutant DBD, with X‑ray evidence of Cys220 engagement and thermal stabilization.

([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-024-01307-4))\n\n**4. Proximity‑Inducing Cytotoxic Strategies (2025)**  \n- **Mutant p53 abundance as a targeting handle**: A bifunctional molecule that binds **p53‑Y220C** and recruits a **PLK1 inhibitor** forms a ternary complex and selectively kills TP53‑mutant cells by proximity‑driven PLK1 inhibition, independent of p53 transcriptional activity.
