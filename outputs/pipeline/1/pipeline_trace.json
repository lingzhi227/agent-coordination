The variant is c.68_69delAG (historical BIC 185delAG/187delAG), with GRCh38 coordinates chr17:43124028-43124029 and GRCh37 coordinates chr17:41276045-41276046. citeturn5view0\n- **Exon and consequence:** It is a 2‑bp deletion in exon 2 that causes a frameshift and premature termination. citeturn5view0\n- **Protein impact:** HGVS protein consequence is p.Glu23Valfs*17 (premature stop 17 amino acids downstream; truncation around codon 39). citeturn3view0\n- **Database status:** ClinVar classifies it as pathogenic with multiple submissions; ClinVar also notes LOVD entries for the variant. citeturn5view0turn3view0\n\n**2) Functional Impact on DNA Repair**\n- BRCA1 (with BARD1) is central to homologous recombination (HR) repair, end resection, and DNA damage response signaling. citeturn13view0\n- This early truncation is expected to abolish BRCA1 function (loss of critical domains and likely nonsense‑mediated decay), leading to HR deficiency and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. citeturn3view0turn13view0\n\n**3) Population Frequency and Founder Context**\n- **Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) prevalence:** Population studies report AJ carrier frequency around **1 in 40** for any of the three founder variants, with c.68_69delAG typically around **0.96–1.14%**. citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **Other AJ founder variants:** BRCA1 c.5266dupC (5382insC) and BRCA2 c.5946delT (6174delT). citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **General population (gnomAD):** ClinVar reports 58/282,442 alleles overall (~0.0205%) and 42/10,368 AJ alleles (~0.405%). These are dataset frequencies, not population‑representative prevalence. citeturn5view0\n\n**4) Penetrance and Cancer Risk (Latest Large Cohorts + Variant‑Specific Data)**\n- **Large prospective cohort (BRCA1 overall):** Cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 is ~**72%**, and ovarian cancer risk is ~**44%** for BRCA1 carriers. Family history increases risk (HR ~1.99 for ≥2 first‑degree relatives). citeturn11view0\n- **Age‑specific ovarian risk:** BRCA1 ovarian risk is ~**0.55% by age 35**, supporting risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) around **35–40** after childbearing. citeturn10view0\n- **Variant‑specific penetrance ranges (185delAG):** Reported lifetime breast cancer risk **55–83% by age 70** and ovarian cancer risk **12–58% by age 70** across founder‑mutation cohorts. citeturn3view0\n- **Genotype–phenotype correlation (location effect):** BRCA1 mutation position affects relative breast vs ovarian risk; mutations outside the c.2282–c.4071 region have higher breast‑cancer risk. c.68_69delAG lies outside that region, suggesting relatively higher breast‑cancer propensity compared with variants inside the region, though individual risk is still strongly influenced by family history. citeturn11view0\n\n**5) Expected Tumor Pathology**\n- **Breast cancer:** BRCA1‑associated tumors are commonly high‑grade invasive ductal carcinomas, frequently triple‑negative, and often p53‑positive. citeturn15view0\n- **Ovarian cancer:** Predominantly high‑grade serous carcinoma. citeturn15view0\n\n**6) Evidence‑Based Prevention and Surveillance**\n- **Breast surveillance (NCCN‑consistent):** Clinical breast exam every 6–12 months starting at 25; annual breast MRI from 25; annual mammography from 30 (often alternating every 6 months with MRI). citeturn9view0turn15view0\n- **Ovarian surveillance:** No screening method has proven mortality benefit; CA‑125 and transvaginal ultrasound can be considered only if RRSO is deferred, with clear counseling about limitations. citeturn8view0turn9view0\n- **Risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy:** Recommended for BRCA1 carriers at **35–40** after childbearing; reduces ovarian cancer risk by **~70–85%** and improves survival. citeturn8view0\n- **Risk‑reducing mastectomy:** A guideline‑supported option to substantially reduce breast cancer risk; choice depends on patient values and family history. citeturn15view0turn9view0\n- **Chemoprevention:** Oral contraceptives reduce ovarian cancer risk in BRCA carriers; impact on breast cancer risk is less certain and requires individualized counseling. citeturn8view0\n\n**7) Treatment Strategies If Cancer Develops**\n- **Mechanism‑based sensitivity:** HR‑deficient BRCA1 tumors are more sensitive to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibition. citeturn13view0\n- **FDA‑approved PARP inhibitors (key examples):**\n  - Olaparib for germline BRCA‑mutated, HER2‑negative metastatic breast cancer. citeturn16view0\n  - Talazoparib for germline BRCA‑mutated, HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. citeturn17view0\n  - Niraparib for first‑line maintenance in advanced ovarian cancer, and olaparib + bevacizumab for HRD‑positive advanced ovarian cancer. citeturn17view0turn18view0\n  - Rucaparib for maintenance treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer after response to platinum. citeturn18view0\n\n**Notes on Genotype–Phenotype Specificity for c.68_69delAG**\nDirect evidence that this specific founder mutation has a distinct tumor spectrum or penetrance compared with other truncating BRCA1 variants is limited. Most data support that it behaves like a classic BRCA1 loss‑of‑function mutation, with the main measurable modifier being mutation location and family history. citeturn11view0turn3view0\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the management section to this patient’s reproductive plans and preferences, or summarize current NCCN/ASCO‑aligned recommendations in a one‑page clinical handout.\n\n**Sources**\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/VCV000017662/`\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12005690/`\n- `https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201477`\n- `https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2643761`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29325405/`\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31308446/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7863621/`\n- `https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.202255998`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-breast-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-talazoparib-gbrca-her2-negative-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-breast-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-niraparib-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-plus-bevacizumab-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer`\n- `https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/rucaparib`",

The variant is c.68_69delAG (historical BIC 185delAG/187delAG), with GRCh38 coordinates chr17:43124028-43124029 and GRCh37 coordinates chr17:41276045-41276046. citeturn5view0\n- **Exon and consequence:** It is a 2‑bp deletion in exon 2 that causes a frameshift and premature termination. citeturn5view0\n- **Protein impact:** HGVS protein consequence is p.Glu23Valfs*17 (premature stop 17 amino acids downstream; truncation around codon 39). citeturn3view0\n- **Database status:** ClinVar classifies it as pathogenic with multiple submissions; ClinVar also notes LOVD entries for the variant. citeturn5view0turn3view0\n\n**2) Functional Impact on DNA Repair**\n- BRCA1 (with BARD1) is central to homologous recombination (HR) repair, end resection, and DNA damage response signaling. citeturn13view0\n- This early truncation is expected to abolish BRCA1 function (loss of critical domains and likely nonsense‑mediated decay), leading to HR deficiency and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. citeturn3view0turn13view0\n\n**3) Population Frequency and Founder Context**\n- **Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) prevalence:** Population studies report AJ carrier frequency around **1 in 40** for any of the three founder variants, with c.68_69delAG typically around **0.96–1.14%**. citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **Other AJ founder variants:** BRCA1 c.5266dupC (5382insC) and BRCA2 c.5946delT (6174delT). citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **General population (gnomAD):** ClinVar reports 58/282,442 alleles overall (~0.0205%) and 42/10,368 AJ alleles (~0.405%). These are dataset frequencies, not population‑representative prevalence. citeturn5view0\n\n**4) Penetrance and Cancer Risk (Latest Large Cohorts + Variant‑Specific Data)**\n- **Large prospective cohort (BRCA1 overall):** Cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 is ~**72%**, and ovarian cancer risk is ~**44%** for BRCA1 carriers. Family history increases risk (HR ~1.99 for ≥2 first‑degree relatives). citeturn11view0\n- **Age‑specific ovarian risk:** BRCA1 ovarian risk is ~**0.55% by age 35**, supporting risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) around **35–40** after childbearing. citeturn10view0\n- **Variant‑specific penetrance ranges (185delAG):** Reported lifetime breast cancer risk **55–83% by age 70** and ovarian cancer risk **12–58% by age 70** across founder‑mutation cohorts. citeturn3view0\n- **Genotype–phenotype correlation (location effect):** BRCA1 mutation position affects relative breast vs ovarian risk; mutations outside the c.2282–c.4071 region have higher breast‑cancer risk. c.68_69delAG lies outside that region, suggesting relatively higher breast‑cancer propensity compared with variants inside the region, though individual risk is still strongly influenced by family history. citeturn11view0\n\n**5) Expected Tumor Pathology**\n- **Breast cancer:** BRCA1‑associated tumors are commonly high‑grade invasive ductal carcinomas, frequently triple‑negative, and often p53‑positive. citeturn15view0\n- **Ovarian cancer:** Predominantly high‑grade serous carcinoma. citeturn15view0\n\n**6) Evidence‑Based Prevention and Surveillance**\n- **Breast surveillance (NCCN‑consistent):** Clinical breast exam every 6–12 months starting at 25; annual breast MRI from 25; annual mammography from 30 (often alternating every 6 months with MRI). citeturn9view0turn15view0\n- **Ovarian surveillance:** No screening method has proven mortality benefit; CA‑125 and transvaginal ultrasound can be considered only if RRSO is deferred, with clear counseling about limitations. citeturn8view0turn9view0\n- **Risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy:** Recommended for BRCA1 carriers at **35–40** after childbearing; reduces ovarian cancer risk by **~70–85%** and improves survival. citeturn8view0\n- **Risk‑reducing mastectomy:** A guideline‑supported option to substantially reduce breast cancer risk; choice depends on patient values and family history. citeturn15view0turn9view0\n- **Chemoprevention:** Oral contraceptives reduce ovarian cancer risk in BRCA carriers; impact on breast cancer risk is less certain and requires individualized counseling. citeturn8view0\n\n**7) Treatment Strategies If Cancer Develops**\n- **Mechanism‑based sensitivity:** HR‑deficient BRCA1 tumors are more sensitive to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibition. citeturn13view0\n- **FDA‑approved PARP inhibitors (key examples):**\n  - Olaparib for germline BRCA‑mutated, HER2‑negative metastatic breast cancer. citeturn16view0\n  - Talazoparib for germline BRCA‑mutated, HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. citeturn17view0\n  - Niraparib for first‑line maintenance in advanced ovarian cancer, and olaparib + bevacizumab for HRD‑positive advanced ovarian cancer. citeturn17view0turn18view0\n  - Rucaparib for maintenance treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer after response to platinum. citeturn18view0\n\n**Notes on Genotype–Phenotype Specificity for c.68_69delAG**\nDirect evidence that this specific founder mutation has a distinct tumor spectrum or penetrance compared with other truncating BRCA1 variants is limited. Most data support that it behaves like a classic BRCA1 loss‑of‑function mutation, with the main measurable modifier being mutation location and family history. citeturn11view0turn3view0\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the management section to this patient’s reproductive plans and preferences, or summarize current NCCN/ASCO‑aligned recommendations in a one‑page clinical handout.\n\n**Sources**\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/VCV000017662/`\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12005690/`\n- `https://www.nature.com/articles/gim201477`\n- `https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2643761`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29325405/`\n- `https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31308446/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7863621/`\n- `https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.202255998`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-breast-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-talazoparib-gbrca-her2-negative-locally-advanced-or-metastatic-breast-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-niraparib-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer`\n- `https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-plus-bevacizumab-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer`\n- `https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/rucaparib`"

Build upon the genomics findings provided.\n\nContext from previous work:\nUsing `web-search` skill to gather current ClinVar/LOVD, population frequency, penetrance, and guideline evidence.\n\n**Context Summary (This Case)**\nThis patient carries the Ashkenazi Jewish founder BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG) mutation, a well‑established pathogenic early truncating variant with high lifetime risks for breast and ovarian cancer. citeturn5view0\n\n**1) Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- **Locus and coordinates:** BRCA1 is on chromosome 17q21.31. The variant is c.68_69delAG (historical BIC 185delAG/187delAG), with GRCh38 coordinates chr17:43124028-43124029 and GRCh37 coordinates chr17:41276045-41276046. citeturn5view0\n- **Exon and consequence:** It is a 2‑bp deletion in exon 2 that causes a frameshift and premature termination. citeturn5view0\n- **Protein impact:** HGVS protein consequence is p.Glu23Valfs*17 (premature stop 17 amino acids downstream; truncation around codon 39). citeturn3view0\n- **Database status:** ClinVar classifies it as pathogenic with multiple submissions; ClinVar also notes LOVD entries for the variant. citeturn5view0turn3view0\n\n**2) Functional Impact on DNA Repair**\n- BRCA1 (with BARD1) is central to homologous recombination (HR) repair, end resection, and DNA damage response signaling. citeturn13view0\n- This early truncation is expected to abolish BRCA1 function (loss of critical domains and likely nonsense‑mediated decay), leading to HR deficiency and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. citeturn3view0turn13view0\n\n**3) Population Frequency and Founder Context**\n- **Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) prevalence:** Population studies report AJ carrier frequency around **1 in 40** for any of the three founder variants, with c.68_69delAG typically around **0.96–1.14%**. citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **Other AJ founder variants:** BRCA1 c.5266dupC (5382insC) and BRCA2 c.5946delT (6174delT). citeturn4view0turn0view0\n- **General population (gnomAD):** ClinVar reports 58/282,442 alleles overall (~0.0205%) and 42/10,368 AJ alleles (~0.405%).

([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \nBRCA1’s key domains are positioned at the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal tandem BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Inference:** because the stop is around aa 39, the truncated product would eliminate essentially all functional RING domain architecture and completely remove the coiled‑coil and BRCT domains, so the protein cannot perform canonical BRCA1 scaffolding or signaling functions. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**RING Domain and BRCA1–BARD1 E3 Ligase**  \nThe BRCA1 and BARD1 N‑terminal RING domains form an obligate heterodimer that is a RING‑type E3 ubiquitin ligase—the only known enzymatic activity of the complex. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nThis heterodimer specifically monoubiquitylates nucleosomal H2A at K125/K127/K129, a chromatin signal implicated in DNA damage response and repair. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nBRCA1–BARD1 also promotes initial DNA end resection and recruits/regulates RAD51 during homologous recombination (HR). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7204409/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of a functional RING domain prevents stable BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimer formation and abrogates the E3 ligase activity and its chromatin‑based signaling at damage sites. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**BRCT Domains and Damage‑Site Recruitment**  \nBRCA1’s tandem BRCT repeats form phosphoprotein‑binding modules that recognize pSXXF motifs in key partners (CtIP, BACH1, Abraxas/CCDC98), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** complete loss of BRCT domains eliminates these phospho‑dependent interactions, disrupting BRCA1 recruitment and DNA damage signaling.

([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \nPALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and stabilizes RAD51 filaments, supporting HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/))  \nBRCA2, via its BRC repeats and C‑terminal RAD51‑binding region, recruits RAD51 to ssDNA and stabilizes the presynaptic filament. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36211-x))  \nSingle‑molecule studies show BRCA2 can directly nucleate and stabilize RAD51 on ssDNA and deliver RAD51 to DNA junctions. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276523005075))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of BRCA1’s coiled‑coil and BRCT domains blocks PALB2 recruitment and undermines the BRCA1‑PALB2‑BRCA2‑RAD51 loading axis, leading to HR failure and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n\n**BRCAness and Synthetic Lethality with PARP Inhibition**  \n“BRCAness” denotes tumors with HR defects that phenocopy BRCA1/2 loss and show increased sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents and PARP inhibitors; it can be measured by HRD scores, LST, mutational signatures, or RAD51 foci. ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article-abstract/26/9/e1526/6512109))  \nMechanistically, synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors is still actively debated: recent work highlights transcription–replication conflict (TRC) resolution as a key driver of PARPi lethality in HR‑deficient cells (catalytic inhibition over trapping), while other genetic evidence supports PARP1 trapping as a major efficacy driver in BRCA1‑mutant cells.

              "text": "Using the `web-search` skill.\n\n**Molecular Consequences of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**  \nThis variant causes a frameshift at codon 23 with a premature stop 17 amino acids downstream and is predicted to result in protein truncation or nonsense‑mediated decay. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \nBRCA1’s key domains are positioned at the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal tandem BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Inference:** because the stop is around aa 39, the truncated product would eliminate essentially all functional RING domain architecture and completely remove the coiled‑coil and BRCT domains, so the protein cannot perform canonical BRCA1 scaffolding or signaling functions. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**RING Domain and BRCA1–BARD1 E3 Ligase**  \nThe BRCA1 and BARD1 N‑terminal RING domains form an obligate heterodimer that is a RING‑type E3 ubiquitin ligase—the only known enzymatic activity of the complex. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nThis heterodimer specifically monoubiquitylates nucleosomal H2A at K125/K127/K129, a chromatin signal implicated in DNA damage response and repair. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nBRCA1–BARD1 also promotes initial DNA end resection and recruits/regulates RAD51 during homologous recombination (HR). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7204409/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of a functional RING domain prevents stable BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimer formation and abrogates the E3 ligase activity and its chromatin‑based signaling at damage sites. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**BRCT Domains and Damage‑Site Recruitment**  \nBRCA1’s tandem BRCT repeats form phosphoprotein‑binding modules that recognize pSXXF motifs in key partners (CtIP, BACH1, Abraxas/CCDC98), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** complete loss of BRCT domains eliminates these phospho‑dependent interactions, disrupting BRCA1 recruitment and DNA damage signaling. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n\n**BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2–RAD51 Axis (HRR)**  \nBRCA1 uses its coiled‑coil domain (aa 1367–1437) to bind PALB2’s coiled‑coil, a key physical link between BRCA1 and PALB2. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \nPALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and stabilizes RAD51 filaments, supporting HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/))  \nBRCA2, via its BRC repeats and C‑terminal RAD51‑binding region, recruits RAD51 to ssDNA and stabilizes the presynaptic filament. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36211-x))  \nSingle‑molecule studies show BRCA2 can directly nucleate and stabilize RAD51 on ssDNA and deliver RAD51 to DNA junctions. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276523005075))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of BRCA1’s coiled‑coil and BRCT domains blocks PALB2 recruitment and undermines the BRCA1‑PALB2‑BRCA2‑RAD51 loading axis, leading to HR failure and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n\n**BRCAness and Synthetic Lethality with PARP Inhibition**  \n“BRCAness” denotes tumors with HR defects that phenocopy BRCA1/2 loss and show increased sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents and PARP inhibitors; it can be measured by HRD scores, LST, mutational signatures, or RAD51 foci. ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article-abstract/26/9/e1526/6512109))  \nMechanistically, synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors is still actively debated: recent work highlights transcription–replication conflict (TRC) resolution as a key driver of PARPi lethality in HR‑deficient cells (catalytic inhibition over trapping), while other genetic evidence supports PARP1 trapping as a major efficacy driver in BRCA1‑mutant cells. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01893-2))  \n\n**Documented Compensatory or Reversion Mechanisms**  \n- Secondary reversion mutations can restore the BRCA1/2 open reading frame and reinstate BRCT/RING functionality, leading to PARP‑inhibitor resistance. ([molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-020-01227-0))  \n- Secondary BRCA1 splice‑site mutations that increase ∆11/∆11q isoforms have been shown to drive PARP‑inhibitor resistance. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11299415/))  \n- Loss of 53BP1 or shieldin pathway components (SHLD1/2/3, REV7) restores end resection and HR in BRCA1‑deficient cells, reducing PARP‑inhibitor sensitivity.

Integrate the molecular findings from previous experts into a pathological risk profile.\n\nContext from previous work:\nUsing the `web-search` skill.\n\n**Molecular Consequences of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**  \nThis variant causes a frameshift at codon 23 with a premature stop 17 amino acids downstream and is predicted to result in protein truncation or nonsense‑mediated decay. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \nBRCA1’s key domains are positioned at the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal tandem BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Inference:** because the stop is around aa 39, the truncated product would eliminate essentially all functional RING domain architecture and completely remove the coiled‑coil and BRCT domains, so the protein cannot perform canonical BRCA1 scaffolding or signaling functions. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**RING Domain and BRCA1–BARD1 E3 Ligase**  \nThe BRCA1 and BARD1 N‑terminal RING domains form an obligate heterodimer that is a RING‑type E3 ubiquitin ligase—the only known enzymatic activity of the complex. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nThis heterodimer specifically monoubiquitylates nucleosomal H2A at K125/K127/K129, a chromatin signal implicated in DNA damage response and repair. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/))  \nBRCA1–BARD1 also promotes initial DNA end resection and recruits/regulates RAD51 during homologous recombination (HR). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7204409/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of a functional RING domain prevents stable BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimer formation and abrogates the E3 ligase activity and its chromatin‑based signaling at damage sites. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000213650.5/))  \n\n**BRCT Domains and Damage‑Site Recruitment**  \nBRCA1’s tandem BRCT repeats form phosphoprotein‑binding modules that recognize pSXXF motifs in key partners (CtIP, BACH1, Abraxas/CCDC98), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** complete loss of BRCT domains eliminates these phospho‑dependent interactions, disrupting BRCA1 recruitment and DNA damage signaling. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n\n**BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2–RAD51 Axis (HRR)**  \nBRCA1 uses its coiled‑coil domain (aa 1367–1437) to bind PALB2’s coiled‑coil, a key physical link between BRCA1 and PALB2. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \nPALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and stabilizes RAD51 filaments, supporting HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/))  \nBRCA2, via its BRC repeats and C‑terminal RAD51‑binding region, recruits RAD51 to ssDNA and stabilizes the presynaptic filament. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36211-x))  \nSingle‑molecule studies show BRCA2 can directly nucleate and stabilize RAD51 on ssDNA and deliver RAD51 to DNA junctions. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276523005075))  \n**Implication for 185delAG:** loss of BRCA1’s coiled‑coil and BRCT domains blocks PALB2 recruitment and undermines the BRCA1‑PALB2‑BRCA2‑RAD51 loading axis, leading to HR failure and reliance on error‑prone repair pathways. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/))  \n\n**BRCAness and Synthetic Lethality with PARP Inhibition**  \n“BRCAness” denotes tumors with HR defects that phenocopy BRCA1/2 loss and show increased sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents and PARP inhibitors; it can be measured by HRD scores, LST, mutational signatures, or RAD51 foci. ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article-abstract/26/9/e1526/6512109))  \nMechanistically, synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors is still actively debated: recent work highlights transcription–replication conflict (TRC) resolution as a key driver of PARPi lethality in HR‑deficient cells (catalytic inhibition over trapping), while other genetic evidence supports PARP1 trapping as a major efficacy driver in BRCA1‑mutant cells. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01893-2))  \n\n**Documented Compensatory or Reversion Mechanisms**  \n- Secondary reversion mutations can restore the BRCA1/2 open reading frame and reinstate BRCT/RING functionality, leading to PARP‑inhibitor resistance. ([molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-020-01227-0))  \n- Secondary BRCA1 splice‑site mutations that increase ∆11/∆11q isoforms have been shown to drive PARP‑inhibitor resistance. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11299415/))  \n- Loss of 53BP1 or shieldin pathway components (SHLD1/2/3, REV7) restores end resection and HR in BRCA1‑deficient cells, reducing PARP‑inhibitor sensitivity.

That causes profound homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and drives the classic BRCA1 tumor phenotype: early‑onset, high‑grade, basal‑like/triple‑negative breast cancer and high‑grade serous tubo‑ovarian carcinoma with pronounced genomic instability and an immune‑reactive microenvironment. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**1. Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- The c.68_69delAG variant (p.Glu23ValfsTer17) is a well‑known Ashkenazi founder mutation that causes a frameshift and premature stop around aa 39, leading to nonsense‑mediated decay or a nonfunctional truncated protein. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/?utm_source=openai))\n- BRCA1’s key functional domains are the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). A stop near aa 39 effectively removes all of these domains. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. How the Protein Defect Disrupts DNA Repair**\n- The RING domain is required for BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimerization and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, including site‑specific H2A K125/K127/K129 monoubiquitination at damage sites; loss of this domain abrogates this enzymatic function. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/?utm_source=openai))\n- The BRCT domains bind phosphorylated pSPxF motifs in damage‑response partners (e.g., Abraxas, BACH1, CtIP), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs; loss blocks this recruitment axis. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4747905/?utm_source=openai))\n- The coiled‑coil domain mediates BRCA1–PALB2 binding; PALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and RAD51 to assemble HR machinery. Loss of this interface impairs RAD51 loading and HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Cancer Risk Profile (with lifetime risk estimates)**\n- Breast cancer: 72% cumulative risk by age 80 for BRCA1 carriers; peak incidence in the 41–50 age decade. Family history further increases risk. General population lifetime risk is ~12.9%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer: 44% cumulative risk by age 80 in a large prospective cohort; another cohort estimates ~49% by age 80 with mean diagnosis at ~51 years for BRCA1. General population lifetime risk is ~1.12%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic cancer: cumulative incidence to age 80 is ~2.2% for BRCA1 carriers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11694537/?utm_source=openai))\n- Contralateral breast cancer (if a first breast cancer occurs): ~40% cumulative risk 20 years after the first diagnosis. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Other cancers: evidence for increased risks (e.g., melanoma, GI) is inconsistent; NCCN‑based guidance emphasizes pancreatic screening only with a relevant family history. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n\n**4. Expected Tumor Pathology**\n- Breast: most BRCA1‑associated tumors are invasive carcinoma of no special type, high grade, often with medullary‑like features, pushing borders, high mitotic activity, and prominent lymphocytic infiltrates. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/tubo‑ovarian: overwhelmingly high‑grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), frequently arising from the distal fallopian tube via serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) or p53‑signature lesions. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6970023/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Molecular Subtypes and IHC Profiles**\n- Breast molecular subtype: BRCA1 tumors are predominantly basal‑like and triple‑negative; >75% are TN/basal‑like in large series. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304394/?utm_source=openai))\n- Breast IHC: ER‑negative, PR‑negative, HER2‑negative, high grade, often p53 positive; basal markers (CK5/6, CK14) are enriched in BRCA1 tumors and in TN/basal‑like cancers. ([breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com](https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr1863?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian HGSC IHC: WT1 positive, PAX8 positive, aberrant p53 (overexpression or null), diffuse p16. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11664289/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6. Age of Onset and Grade**\n- Breast: peak incidence in BRCA1 carriers occurs in the 40s (41–50), with tumors typically grade 3. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian: mean age at diagnosis around 51 years in BRCA1 carriers, younger than the general population (median ~63 years). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793803/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**7. Tumor Microenvironment and Genomic Instability**\n- BRCA1 breast cancers often show lymphocytic infiltrates and medullary‑like immune‑rich morphology, consistent with an inflamed microenvironment. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- PD‑L1 expression and TILs are common in TNBC; PD‑L1‑positive immune cells are frequent and prognostically relevant in HGSC as well. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30524905/?utm_source=openai))\n- HRD genomic scar scores (LOH, TAI, LST) are strongly associated with BRCA1/2 deficiency and are commonly elevated in BRCA1‑mutant tumors. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25475740/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**8. Evidence‑Based Prevention, Surveillance, and Treatment (NCCN‑aligned)**\nNote: NCCN guideline full text (Version 2.2026) is login‑restricted; the 2026 peer‑reviewed policy paper below summarizes NCCN recommendations alongside other international guidance.\n\n- Breast surveillance: start at age ≥25 with annual MRI and clinical breast exams; add annual mammography by age 30 (continue both to 75, then individualize). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Risk‑reducing mastectomy: discuss as an option; timing is individualized, often 30–55. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Ovarian risk reduction: risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended for BRCA1 at 35–40 after childbearing; routine ovarian screening is not recommended, and CA‑125/US have limited sensitivity/specificity. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- RRSO impact: reduces ovarian cancer risk by >90% and can reduce breast cancer risk, though magnitude varies across studies. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic surveillance: NCCN‑aligned guidance suggests screening BRCA1 carriers only if there is a first‑ or second‑degree relative with exocrine pancreatic cancer, starting at age 50 or 5–10 years earlier than the youngest affected relative; MRI/MRCP or EUS in experienced centers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Systemic treatment if cancer develops: BRCA1‑associated HRD predicts sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors; HRD scores help identify HRD tumors beyond germline testing.

That causes profound homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and drives the classic BRCA1 tumor phenotype: early‑onset, high‑grade, basal‑like/triple‑negative breast cancer and high‑grade serous tubo‑ovarian carcinoma with pronounced genomic instability and an immune‑reactive microenvironment.

Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- The c.68_69delAG variant (p.Glu23ValfsTer17) is a well‑known Ashkenazi founder mutation that causes a frameshift and premature stop around aa 39, leading to nonsense‑mediated decay or a nonfunctional truncated protein. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/?utm_source=openai))\n- BRCA1’s key functional domains are the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). A stop near aa 39 effectively removes all of these domains. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. How the Protein Defect Disrupts DNA Repair**\n- The RING domain is required for BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimerization and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, including site‑specific H2A K125/K127/K129 monoubiquitination at damage sites; loss of this domain abrogates this enzymatic function. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/?utm_source=openai))\n- The BRCT domains bind phosphorylated pSPxF motifs in damage‑response partners (e.g., Abraxas, BACH1, CtIP), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs; loss blocks this recruitment axis. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4747905/?utm_source=openai))\n- The coiled‑coil domain mediates BRCA1–PALB2 binding; PALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and RAD51 to assemble HR machinery. Loss of this interface impairs RAD51 loading and HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Cancer Risk Profile (with lifetime risk estimates)**\n- Breast cancer: 72% cumulative risk by age 80 for BRCA1 carriers; peak incidence in the 41–50 age decade. Family history further increases risk. General population lifetime risk is ~12.9%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer: 44% cumulative risk by age 80 in a large prospective cohort; another cohort estimates ~49% by age 80 with mean diagnosis at ~51 years for BRCA1. General population lifetime risk is ~1.12%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic cancer: cumulative incidence to age 80 is ~2.2% for BRCA1 carriers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11694537/?utm_source=openai))\n- Contralateral breast cancer (if a first breast cancer occurs): ~40% cumulative risk 20 years after the first diagnosis. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Other cancers: evidence for increased risks (e.g., melanoma, GI) is inconsistent; NCCN‑based guidance emphasizes pancreatic screening only with a relevant family history. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n\n**4. Expected Tumor Pathology**\n- Breast: most BRCA1‑associated tumors are invasive carcinoma of no special type, high grade, often with medullary‑like features, pushing borders, high mitotic activity, and prominent lymphocytic infiltrates. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/tubo‑ovarian: overwhelmingly high‑grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), frequently arising from the distal fallopian tube via serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) or p53‑signature lesions. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6970023/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Molecular Subtypes and IHC Profiles**\n- Breast molecular subtype: BRCA1 tumors are predominantly basal‑like and triple‑negative; >75% are TN/basal‑like in large series. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304394/?utm_source=openai))\n- Breast IHC: ER‑negative, PR‑negative, HER2‑negative, high grade, often p53 positive; basal markers (CK5/6, CK14) are enriched in BRCA1 tumors and in TN/basal‑like cancers. ([breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com](https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr1863?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian HGSC IHC: WT1 positive, PAX8 positive, aberrant p53 (overexpression or null), diffuse p16. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11664289/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6. Age of Onset and Grade**\n- Breast: peak incidence in BRCA1 carriers occurs in the 40s (41–50), with tumors typically grade 3. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian: mean age at diagnosis around 51 years in BRCA1 carriers, younger than the general population (median ~63 years). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793803/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**7. Tumor Microenvironment and Genomic Instability**\n- BRCA1 breast cancers often show lymphocytic infiltrates and medullary‑like immune‑rich morphology, consistent with an inflamed microenvironment. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- PD‑L1 expression and TILs are common in TNBC; PD‑L1‑positive immune cells are frequent and prognostically relevant in HGSC as well. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30524905/?utm_source=openai))\n- HRD genomic scar scores (LOH, TAI, LST) are strongly associated with BRCA1/2 deficiency and are commonly elevated in BRCA1‑mutant tumors. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25475740/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**8. Evidence‑Based Prevention, Surveillance, and Treatment (NCCN‑aligned)**\nNote: NCCN guideline full text (Version 2.2026) is login‑restricted; the 2026 peer‑reviewed policy paper below summarizes NCCN recommendations alongside other international guidance.\n\n- Breast surveillance: start at age ≥25 with annual MRI and clinical breast exams; add annual mammography by age 30 (continue both to 75, then individualize). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Risk‑reducing mastectomy: discuss as an option; timing is individualized, often 30–55. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Ovarian risk reduction: risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended for BRCA1 at 35–40 after childbearing; routine ovarian screening is not recommended, and CA‑125/US have limited sensitivity/specificity. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- RRSO impact: reduces ovarian cancer risk by >90% and can reduce breast cancer risk, though magnitude varies across studies. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic surveillance: NCCN‑aligned guidance suggests screening BRCA1 carriers only if there is a first‑ or second‑degree relative with exocrine pancreatic cancer, starting at age 50 or 5–10 years earlier than the youngest affected relative; MRI/MRCP or EUS in experienced centers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Systemic treatment if cancer develops: BRCA1‑associated HRD predicts sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors; HRD scores help identify HRD tumors beyond germline testing.

Synthesize all prior research into actionable clinical recommendations.\n\nContext from previous work:\nUsing `web-search` to pull NCCN/SEER/pathology sources and cite them.\n\n**Summary**\nThis BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG) founder mutation is a loss‑of‑function frameshift that truncates BRCA1 near the N‑terminus, eliminating the RING, coiled‑coil, and BRCT domains. That causes profound homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and drives the classic BRCA1 tumor phenotype: early‑onset, high‑grade, basal‑like/triple‑negative breast cancer and high‑grade serous tubo‑ovarian carcinoma with pronounced genomic instability and an immune‑reactive microenvironment. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**1. Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- The c.68_69delAG variant (p.Glu23ValfsTer17) is a well‑known Ashkenazi founder mutation that causes a frameshift and premature stop around aa 39, leading to nonsense‑mediated decay or a nonfunctional truncated protein. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV004566751/?utm_source=openai))\n- BRCA1’s key functional domains are the N‑terminal RING (aa 24–65), the coiled‑coil (aa 1364–1437), and the C‑terminal BRCT repeats (aa 1646–1863). A stop near aa 39 effectively removes all of these domains. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974778/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. How the Protein Defect Disrupts DNA Repair**\n- The RING domain is required for BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimerization and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, including site‑specific H2A K125/K127/K129 monoubiquitination at damage sites; loss of this domain abrogates this enzymatic function. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10390874/?utm_source=openai))\n- The BRCT domains bind phosphorylated pSPxF motifs in damage‑response partners (e.g., Abraxas, BACH1, CtIP), enabling BRCA1 recruitment and signaling at DSBs; loss blocks this recruitment axis. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4747905/?utm_source=openai))\n- The coiled‑coil domain mediates BRCA1–PALB2 binding; PALB2 bridges BRCA1 to BRCA2 and RAD51 to assemble HR machinery. Loss of this interface impairs RAD51 loading and HR. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12270392/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Cancer Risk Profile (with lifetime risk estimates)**\n- Breast cancer: 72% cumulative risk by age 80 for BRCA1 carriers; peak incidence in the 41–50 age decade. Family history further increases risk. General population lifetime risk is ~12.9%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer: 44% cumulative risk by age 80 in a large prospective cohort; another cohort estimates ~49% by age 80 with mean diagnosis at ~51 years for BRCA1. General population lifetime risk is ~1.12%. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632866/?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic cancer: cumulative incidence to age 80 is ~2.2% for BRCA1 carriers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11694537/?utm_source=openai))\n- Contralateral breast cancer (if a first breast cancer occurs): ~40% cumulative risk 20 years after the first diagnosis. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Other cancers: evidence for increased risks (e.g., melanoma, GI) is inconsistent; NCCN‑based guidance emphasizes pancreatic screening only with a relevant family history. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n\n**4. Expected Tumor Pathology**\n- Breast: most BRCA1‑associated tumors are invasive carcinoma of no special type, high grade, often with medullary‑like features, pushing borders, high mitotic activity, and prominent lymphocytic infiltrates. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian/tubo‑ovarian: overwhelmingly high‑grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), frequently arising from the distal fallopian tube via serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) or p53‑signature lesions. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6970023/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Molecular Subtypes and IHC Profiles**\n- Breast molecular subtype: BRCA1 tumors are predominantly basal‑like and triple‑negative; >75% are TN/basal‑like in large series. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304394/?utm_source=openai))\n- Breast IHC: ER‑negative, PR‑negative, HER2‑negative, high grade, often p53 positive; basal markers (CK5/6, CK14) are enriched in BRCA1 tumors and in TN/basal‑like cancers. ([breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com](https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr1863?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian HGSC IHC: WT1 positive, PAX8 positive, aberrant p53 (overexpression or null), diffuse p16. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11664289/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6. Age of Onset and Grade**\n- Breast: peak incidence in BRCA1 carriers occurs in the 40s (41–50), with tumors typically grade 3. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/brca-mutation-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian: mean age at diagnosis around 51 years in BRCA1 carriers, younger than the general population (median ~63 years). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793803/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**7. Tumor Microenvironment and Genomic Instability**\n- BRCA1 breast cancers often show lymphocytic infiltrates and medullary‑like immune‑rich morphology, consistent with an inflamed microenvironment. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC138498/?utm_source=openai))\n- PD‑L1 expression and TILs are common in TNBC; PD‑L1‑positive immune cells are frequent and prognostically relevant in HGSC as well. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30524905/?utm_source=openai))\n- HRD genomic scar scores (LOH, TAI, LST) are strongly associated with BRCA1/2 deficiency and are commonly elevated in BRCA1‑mutant tumors. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25475740/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**8. Evidence‑Based Prevention, Surveillance, and Treatment (NCCN‑aligned)**\nNote: NCCN guideline full text (Version 2.2026) is login‑restricted; the 2026 peer‑reviewed policy paper below summarizes NCCN recommendations alongside other international guidance.\n\n- Breast surveillance: start at age ≥25 with annual MRI and clinical breast exams; add annual mammography by age 30 (continue both to 75, then individualize). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Risk‑reducing mastectomy: discuss as an option; timing is individualized, often 30–55. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Ovarian risk reduction: risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended for BRCA1 at 35–40 after childbearing; routine ovarian screening is not recommended, and CA‑125/US have limited sensitivity/specificity. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- RRSO impact: reduces ovarian cancer risk by >90% and can reduce breast cancer risk, though magnitude varies across studies. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq?utm_source=openai))\n- Pancreatic surveillance: NCCN‑aligned guidance suggests screening BRCA1 carriers only if there is a first‑ or second‑degree relative with exocrine pancreatic cancer, starting at age 50 or 5–10 years earlier than the youngest affected relative; MRI/MRCP or EUS in experienced centers. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12857140/))\n- Systemic treatment if cancer develops: BRCA1‑associated HRD predicts sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors; HRD scores help identify HRD tumors beyond germline testing.

I used 2024–2025 NCCN‑aligned summaries and FDA sources, plus current trial registries. I’ll note where NCCN professional text is paywalled and rely on publicly accessible NCCN‑derived summaries.\n\n**Mutation & DNA Repair Biology**  \nBRCA1 c.68_69delAG (p.Glu23ValfsTer17, “185delAG”) is a pathogenic Ashkenazi founder frameshift that truncates BRCA1 early, leading to loss of function and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))  \nHRD explains heightened sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents and PARP inhibition, which exploit defective BRCA‑mediated repair. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-disco-olaparib-gbrcam-her2-negative-metastatic-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Risk Profile & Expected Tumor Phenotype**  \nBRCA1 carriers have markedly elevated lifetime risks: breast cancer 55–72% by age 70, ovarian cancer 39–44%, with contralateral breast cancer 40–50% at 20 years. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.risk_of_malignancy_in_individual/?utm_source=openai))  \nBRCA1‑associated breast cancers are typically high‑grade and triple‑negative/basal‑like. ([bmccancer.biomedcentral.com](https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-9-86?utm_source=openai))  \nHigh‑grade serous tubo‑ovarian carcinoma often arises from fallopian tube STIC lesions, supporting tubal origin and the rationale for risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy. ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.531790/full?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n**Risk Reduction (Actionable for Age 35)**  \nProphylactic bilateral mastectomy  \nRisk reduction: up to ~90% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high‑risk women. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-prevention-pdq?utm_source=openai))  \nTiming: individualized; should be discussed now given strong family history (mother at 42, aunt at 38) and BRCA1 status.\n\nRisk‑reducing bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO)  \nRecommended age: 35–40 for BRCA1 after childbearing (NCCN‑aligned recommendations summarized in peer‑reviewed sources). ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814870?utm_source=openai))  \nRisk reduction: ~80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and ~50% reduction in breast cancer incidence when done premenopausally. ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/101/2/69/1208825?utm_source=openai))  \nIf she is not ready for oophorectomy: consider clinical trial enrollment for salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (SOROCk, NCT04251052). ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))  \n\nChemoprevention  \nTamoxifen: evidence supports reduced contralateral breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 carriers with prior breast cancer; primary prevention benefit in unaffected BRCA1 carriers is uncertain because BRCA1 tumors are often ER‑negative. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11130383/?utm_source=openai))  \nOral contraceptives: reduce ovarian cancer risk by ~30–50%, including in BRCA carriers. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet?utm_source=openai))  \nPARP inhibitors for prevention: not FDA‑approved; consider only in clinical trials.\n\n---\n\n**Surveillance (NCCN‑aligned, 2024–2025 summaries)**  \nBreast  \nClinical breast exam every 6–12 months starting at 25. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))  \nAnnual breast MRI starting at 25. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))  \nAnnual mammography starting at 30; for high‑risk patients, NCCN 2024 screening tables also allow “10 years before youngest family diagnosis but not before 30.” ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556050/table/article-18569.table0/?utm_source=openai))  \nPractical schedule now at age 35: alternate MRI and mammography every 6 months (e.g., MRI at month 0, mammogram at month 6), with CBE every 6–12 months.\n\nOvarian  \nRoutine screening is not recommended because CA‑125 and TVUS have poor sensitivity/specificity for early detection. If RRSO is delayed, some clinicians consider CA‑125 and TVUS, but evidence of benefit is limited. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nPancreas  \nScreening only if a close relative has pancreatic cancer; use MRI/MRCP or EUS at experienced centers. ([basser.org](https://www.basser.org/managing-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))  \n\nEmerging screening  \nNo liquid biopsy is FDA‑approved for breast cancer screening, and MCED tests (e.g., Galleri) are not FDA‑approved. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12093179/?utm_source=openai))  \nOvarian liquid biopsy remains investigational and is not recommended for early diagnosis. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040842824000064?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n**Treatment If Cancer Develops (FDA‑Approved, Evidence‑Based)**  \nBreast cancer  \nHigh‑risk early‑stage TNBC: pembrolizumab + chemo neoadjuvantly, then adjuvant pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE‑522). ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-pembrolizumab-high-risk-early-stage-triple-negative-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \ngBRCA‑mutated, HER2‑negative high‑risk early breast cancer after chemo: adjuvant olaparib for 1 year (OlympiA). ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-adjuvant-treatment-high-risk-early-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \nMetastatic HER2‑negative gBRCA breast cancer: olaparib (OlympiAD) and talazoparib (EMBRACA) are FDA‑approved. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-disco-olaparib-gbrcam-her2-negative-metastatic-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \nPD‑L1+ metastatic TNBC: pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (KEYNOTE‑355). ([merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/fda-approves-mercks-keytruda-pembrolizumab-in-combination-with-chemotherapy-for-patients-with-locally-recurrent-unresectable-or-metastatic-triple%E2%80%91negative-breast-cancer-whose/?utm_source=openai))  \nLater‑line mTNBC: sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy) after ≥2 prior lines. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-sacituzumab-govitecan-hziy-metastatic-triple-negative-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \nPlatinum sensitivity: in gBRCA‑mutated TNBC, platinum‑containing regimens show higher pCR rates (meta‑analysis pCR ~0.62–0.66). ([hccpjournal.biomedcentral.com](https://hccpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13053-022-00242-0?utm_source=openai))  \n\nOvarian/tubo‑ovarian cancer  \nStandard backbone: cytoreductive surgery + platinum‑based chemotherapy.  \nMaintenance PARP inhibitors (FDA):  \nOlaparib for BRCA‑mutated advanced ovarian cancer after response to first‑line platinum. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/ovarian-cancer-olaparib-maintenance-therapy?utm_source=openai))  \nNiraparib for first‑line maintenance regardless of biomarker status. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-niraparib-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer?utm_source=openai))  \nOlaparib + bevacizumab for HRD‑positive disease after first‑line chemo + bevacizumab. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017510/?utm_source=openai))  \nNote on evolving labels: in the US, maintenance indications in recurrent platinum‑sensitive BRCA‑wildtype disease were withdrawn for some PARP inhibitors; BRCA‑mutated maintenance indications remain.

([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/cascade-testing/index.html?utm_source=openai))  \n\nReproductive considerations  \nPGT‑M is supported by ASRM for serious adult‑onset conditions when risk reduction options are limited or burdensome; discuss with reproductive endocrinology. ([asrm.org](https://www.asrm.org/practice-guidance/practice-committee-documents/indications-and-management-of-preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-monogenic-conditions-a-committee-opinion-2023/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n**NCCN Note (2024–2025)**  \nNCCN professional guidelines are paywalled. I used publicly available NCCN‑aligned summaries and 2024 NCCN screening tables to construct the surveillance schedule above, which matches standard practice for BRCA1 carriers. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556050/table/article-18569.table0/?utm_source=openai))  \n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one‑page, age‑specific care plan (with a timeline and decision points for RRSO/RRM) or a patient‑facing handout."

I’ll note where NCCN professional text is paywalled and rely on publicly accessible NCCN‑derived summaries.\n\n**Mutation & DNA Repair Biology**  \nBRCA1 c.68_69delAG (p.Glu23ValfsTer17, “185delAG”) is a pathogenic Ashkenazi founder frameshift that truncates BRCA1 early, leading to loss of function and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))  \nHRD explains heightened sensitivity to DNA‑damaging agents and PARP inhibition, which exploit defective BRCA‑mediated repair.

      "final_output": "**Executive Summary**\n- The BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG) variant is a pathogenic Ashkenazi Jewish founder frameshift that truncates BRCA1 early, leading to loss of function. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))\n- Loss of BRCA1 impairs homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, creating homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), genomic instability, and sensitivity to DNA‑damaging therapy and PARP inhibition. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- Lifetime cancer risks are high (breast ~55–72% by 70; ovarian ~39–44%), with BRCA1 tumors commonly high‑grade and often triple‑negative. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.risk_of_malignancy_in_individual/?utm_source=openai))\n- Immediate priorities at age 35: guideline‑based high‑risk breast surveillance, and a time‑anchored decision about risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) after childbearing; risk‑reducing mastectomy remains a strong option for maximal breast risk reduction. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian screening (CA‑125/TVUS) has not proven effective; if oophorectomy is deferred, clinical trial options (e.g., SOROCk) are the evidence‑generating pathway. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**1. Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- Variant: BRCA1 NM_007294.4:c.68_69delAG, p.Glu23ValfsTer17 (185delAG), a two‑base deletion causing a frameshift with early truncation and likely nonsense‑mediated decay. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))\n- Population genetics: 185delAG is a common Ashkenazi Jewish founder variant; founder variants are specifically noted by NCI PDQ for BRCA1 in AJ populations. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- Inheritance: BRCA1‑associated cancer risk is autosomal dominant. This implies a ~50% chance of the variant in each first‑degree relative (inference from inheritance pattern). ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n\n**2. Mechanistic Link: From BRCA1 Loss to HRD and Cancer**\n- BRCA1 behaves as a tumor suppressor; tumors commonly lose the remaining normal allele (loss of heterozygosity), resulting in complete functional loss. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- BRCA1/2 participate in homologous DNA repair and genomic stability; most pathogenic variants truncate the protein and disrupt these pathways. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- HRD drives genomic instability and creates therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibition (synthetic lethality), which underpins the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA‑mutated cancers.

([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2023/07000/executive_summary_of_the_ovarian_cancer_evidence.22.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\n4. **Consider risk‑reducing bilateral mastectomy** (Level B)  \nObservational data show ~90% breast cancer risk reduction in high‑risk women. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65884/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. **If deferring oophorectomy, consider SOROCk trial** (Level C)  \nExperimental alternative under investigation; not standard of care. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. **Discuss oral contraceptives for ovarian risk reduction** (Level B)  \n30%–50% ovarian risk reduction, including in BRCA carriers.

Uncertainty and Evolving Evidence**\n- **Magnitude of breast cancer risk reduction from RRSO**: evidence is mixed on the long‑term breast risk effect, though ovarian risk reduction is robust; current recommendations still favor RRSO for BRCA1. ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2023/07000/executive_summary_of_the_ovarian_cancer_evidence.22.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n- **Salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy**: under study (SOROCk); not yet validated as equivalent to RRSO. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))\n- **Chemoprevention in BRCA1**: limited carrier‑specific data, especially given the high prevalence of triple‑negative phenotypes. ([basser.org](https://www.basser.org/managing-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- **Ovarian screening tools**: CA‑125/TVUS have not shown mortality benefit. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-screening-pdq?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you want, I can convert this into a one‑page clinical plan with a timeline (age 35–45), explicit decision points, and referral checklist for genetics, breast surgery, gyn‑onc, and fertility.\n\n**Possible next steps**\n1. Create a patient‑facing one‑page handout with a timeline and decision tree.  \n2. Draft a clinician referral checklist and surveillance schedule for the next 24 months.  \n3. Expand the treatment section into a therapy‑specific appendix (breast vs ovarian).",

              "text": "**Executive Summary**\n- The BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG) variant is a pathogenic Ashkenazi Jewish founder frameshift that truncates BRCA1 early, leading to loss of function. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))\n- Loss of BRCA1 impairs homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, creating homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), genomic instability, and sensitivity to DNA‑damaging therapy and PARP inhibition. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- Lifetime cancer risks are high (breast ~55–72% by 70; ovarian ~39–44%), with BRCA1 tumors commonly high‑grade and often triple‑negative. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.risk_of_malignancy_in_individual/?utm_source=openai))\n- Immediate priorities at age 35: guideline‑based high‑risk breast surveillance, and a time‑anchored decision about risk‑reducing salpingo‑oophorectomy (RRSO) after childbearing; risk‑reducing mastectomy remains a strong option for maximal breast risk reduction. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n- Ovarian screening (CA‑125/TVUS) has not proven effective; if oophorectomy is deferred, clinical trial options (e.g., SOROCk) are the evidence‑generating pathway. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**1. Molecular Genetics of BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (185delAG)**\n- Variant: BRCA1 NM_007294.4:c.68_69delAG, p.Glu23ValfsTer17 (185delAG), a two‑base deletion causing a frameshift with early truncation and likely nonsense‑mediated decay. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000999994/?utm_source=openai))\n- Population genetics: 185delAG is a common Ashkenazi Jewish founder variant; founder variants are specifically noted by NCI PDQ for BRCA1 in AJ populations. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- Inheritance: BRCA1‑associated cancer risk is autosomal dominant. This implies a ~50% chance of the variant in each first‑degree relative (inference from inheritance pattern). ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n\n**2. Mechanistic Link: From BRCA1 Loss to HRD and Cancer**\n- BRCA1 behaves as a tumor suppressor; tumors commonly lose the remaining normal allele (loss of heterozygosity), resulting in complete functional loss. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- BRCA1/2 participate in homologous DNA repair and genomic stability; most pathogenic variants truncate the protein and disrupt these pathways. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n- HRD drives genomic instability and creates therapeutic vulnerability to PARP inhibition (synthetic lethality), which underpins the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA‑mutated cancers. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-disco-olaparib-gbrcam-her2-negative-metastatic-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Cancer Risk Profile and Expected Tumor Pathology**\n**Risk Estimates (GeneReviews, by age 70 unless stated)**\n| Cancer type | BRCA1 carrier risk |\n|---|---|\n| Breast | 55%–72% |\n| Contralateral breast (after one breast cancer) | 20%–30% at 10 yrs; 40%–50% at 20 yrs |\n| Ovarian | 39%–44% |\n| Pancreatic | 1%–3% |\n([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.risk_of_malignancy_in_individual/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Expected Pathology**\n- BRCA1‑associated breast cancers are frequently high‑grade, poorly differentiated, and often medullary‑like; many are triple‑negative (ER/PR/HER2‑negative). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063560/))\n\n**4. Evidence‑Based Prevention and Surveillance**\n\n**Breast Surveillance (Guideline‑Aligned)**\n- Clinical breast exam every 6–12 months starting at age 25. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n- Annual breast MRI starting at age 25. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n- Annual mammography starting at age 30 (often implemented concurrently with MRI). ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n- NCCN‑aligned screening tables also allow mammography to start 10 years before the earliest family diagnosis, but not before 30; in this family, that still implies age ≥30. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556050/table/article-18569.table0/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Ovarian Surveillance**\n- Routine ovarian screening is not recommended; CA‑125 and TVUS have not effectively detected early ovarian cancer in high‑ or average‑risk women. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Risk‑Reducing Surgery**\n- Risk‑reducing mastectomy: observational data show ~90% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high‑risk women. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65884/?utm_source=openai))\n- RRSO: NCCN‑aligned guidance recommends RRSO at ages 35–40 for BRCA1 carriers after childbearing. ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2023/07000/executive_summary_of_the_ovarian_cancer_evidence.22.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n- Meta‑analysis shows RRSO reduces ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk by ~80% and breast cancer risk by ~50% in BRCA carriers. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19141781/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Risk‑Reducing Medications**\n- Oral contraceptives lower ovarian cancer risk by ~30%–50% and this reduction is seen in BRCA1/2 carriers. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet?utm_source=openai))\n- Chemoprevention (tamoxifen/raloxifene/AIs) has limited BRCA‑specific data; consider only with individualized counseling. ([basser.org](https://www.basser.org/managing-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Clinical Trials / Evolving Strategies**\n- SOROCk (NCT04251052) is evaluating salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy as an alternative risk‑reduction strategy in BRCA1 carriers. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Treatment Implications If Cancer Develops (FDA‑Approved)**\n**Breast Cancer**\n- High‑risk early‑stage TNBC: pembrolizumab + chemotherapy neoadjuvant, then adjuvant pembrolizumab. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-pembrolizumab-high-risk-early-stage-triple-negative-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n- High‑risk early‑stage HER2‑negative gBRCA: adjuvant olaparib for 1 year after chemo and local therapy. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-adjuvant-treatment-high-risk-early-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n- Metastatic HER2‑negative gBRCA: olaparib is approved after prior chemotherapy. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-germline-brca-mutated-metastatic-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n- Metastatic HER2‑negative gBRCA: talazoparib is approved for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-sacituzumab-govitecan-hziy-metastatic-triple-negative-breast-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Ovarian / Fallopian Tube / Primary Peritoneal Cancer**\n- Standard backbone: cytoreductive surgery + platinum‑based chemotherapy (noted across guidelines; treatment details beyond scope of this summary).\n- Maintenance PARP inhibitors: niraparib is FDA‑approved for first‑line maintenance after response to platinum‑based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-niraparib-first-line-maintenance-advanced-ovarian-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n- Olaparib is FDA‑approved for maintenance in recurrent platinum‑responsive ovarian cancer. ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-olaparib-tablets-maintenance-treatment-ovarian-cancer?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6. Decision Framework and Critical Action Items (Evidence‑Leveled)**  \nEvidence levels:  \nLevel A = guideline consensus/RCTs/meta‑analyses/FDA approvals.  \nLevel B = strong observational data or consistent cohort evidence.  \nLevel C = emerging evidence/ongoing trials/limited data.\n\n1. **Genetic counseling + cascade testing of first‑degree relatives** (Level A)  \nRationale: autosomal dominant inheritance and public‑health guidance for cascade testing. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/brca-genes-hp-pdq))\n\n2. **Immediate high‑risk breast surveillance** (Level A)  \nAnnual MRI (from 25), annual mammography (from 30), CBE every 6–12 months. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **RRSO decision at age 35–40 after childbearing** (Level A/B)  \nGuideline‑recommended timing for BRCA1, with strong evidence of ovarian and breast risk reduction. ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2023/07000/executive_summary_of_the_ovarian_cancer_evidence.22.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\n4. **Consider risk‑reducing bilateral mastectomy** (Level B)  \nObservational data show ~90% breast cancer risk reduction in high‑risk women. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65884/?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. **If deferring oophorectomy, consider SOROCk trial** (Level C)  \nExperimental alternative under investigation; not standard of care. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))\n\n6. **Discuss oral contraceptives for ovarian risk reduction** (Level B)  \n30%–50% ovarian risk reduction, including in BRCA carriers. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet?utm_source=openai))\n\n7. **Avoid routine ovarian screening (CA‑125/TVUS)** (Level A)  \nNot effective for early detection; high false‑positive burden. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n8. **Reproductive planning with PGT‑M as an option** (Level B/C)  \nASRM recommends offering PGT‑M when significant reproductive risk exists; it is optional and requires counseling. ([asrm.org](https://www.asrm.org/practice-guidance/practice-committee-documents/indications-and-management-of-preimplantation-genetic-testing-for-monogenic-conditions-a-committee-opinion-2023/?utm_source=openai))\n\n9. **Pancreatic screening only if significant family history** (Level B/C)  \nConsider MRI/MRCP or EUS in a research setting for eligible families. ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1247/table/brca1.T.recommended_surveillance_for_wom/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**7. Uncertainty and Evolving Evidence**\n- **Magnitude of breast cancer risk reduction from RRSO**: evidence is mixed on the long‑term breast risk effect, though ovarian risk reduction is robust; current recommendations still favor RRSO for BRCA1. ([journals.lww.com](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2023/07000/executive_summary_of_the_ovarian_cancer_evidence.22.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n- **Salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy**: under study (SOROCk); not yet validated as equivalent to RRSO. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04251052?utm_source=openai))\n- **Chemoprevention in BRCA1**: limited carrier‑specific data, especially given the high prevalence of triple‑negative phenotypes. ([basser.org](https://www.basser.org/managing-cancer-risk?utm_source=openai))\n- **Ovarian screening tools**: CA‑125/TVUS have not shown mortality benefit. ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-screening-pdq?utm_source=openai))\n\nIf you want, I can convert this into a one‑page clinical plan with a timeline (age 35–45), explicit decision points, and referral checklist for genetics, breast surgery, gyn‑onc, and fertility.\n\n**Possible next steps**\n1. Create a patient‑facing one‑page handout with a timeline and decision tree.  \n2. Draft a clinician referral checklist and surveillance schedule for the next 24 months.  \n3. Expand the treatment section into a therapy‑specific appendix (breast vs ovarian)."
