These patterns are linked to distinct suppressive elements (MDSCs, Tregs, M2‑like TAMs) in excluded/desert states. ([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.1038/s44318-025-00650-7))\n\n**Key Findings With Specific Data Points**\n- MSI‑high CRC has markedly higher epithelial CD8+ T‑cell densities vs MSI‑low/MSS: ORs for CD3+CD8+ naïve, memory, and regulatory subsets are 3.49, 2.82, and 3.04, respectively; stromal CD3+CD4+ memory T cells are lower (OR 0.68). (Thomas et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763680/))  \n- STK11/LKB1‑mutant LUAD shows lower CD3+ and CD8+ T‑cell densities (P=0.0019 and P=0.0072), and STK11 alterations are enriched in PD‑L1‑negative tumors even with intermediate/high TMB (P<0.001). (Skoulidis et al., Cancer Discovery, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/))  \n- CIN‑high tumors show immunosuppressive remodeling: ENPP1 overexpression reduces CD8 and NK infiltration and decreases CD8/Treg ratio; chronic STING rewiring drives exhausted CD8 T cells and M2‑like macrophages with granulocytic MDSCs. (Requesens et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n\n**Genomic Features → TIME Mechanisms (CD8, Tregs, TAMs, MDSCs, NK)**\n**TMB/MSI/MMRd**\nHigh TMB/MMRd increases neoantigen load and cytosolic DNA sensing (cGAS‑STING), boosting CXCL10/CCL5 and IFN‑β to recruit and activate CD8 and NK cells and improve DC–T cell cross‑talk. This underpins immune‑inflamed phenotypes in MSI‑high tumors. (Requesens et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \nSpatial transcriptomics shows MMRd CRC enriched for intratumoral immune hubs with activated T cells and chemokine‑expressing malignant/myeloid cells.

(Requesens et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n\n**STK11/LKB1 Loss**\nSTK11 loss creates a non‑T‑cell‑inflamed, “cold” microenvironment with reduced CD8 infiltration and PD‑L1 expression even at intermediate/high TMB, indicating tumor‑intrinsic immune evasion. (Skoulidis et al., Cancer Discovery, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/))  \nMechanistically, LKB1 loss promotes neutrophil recruitment and suppressive cytokine programs that blunt T‑cell activity.

(Zavitsanou et al., Cell Reports, 2023) ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723013074))  \nNRF2 activation in macrophages can skew toward M2‑like programs (CD163/Arg1↑), linking KEAP1/NRF2 to TAM polarization and immunosuppression. (Wang et al., Cell Commun Signal, 2018) ([biosignaling.biomedcentral.com](https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-018-0262-x?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**KRAS**\nKRAS signaling can downregulate MHC‑I, increase IL‑10/TGF‑β, and recruit MDSCs, promoting Treg induction and TAM/MDSC‑dominant TIME. (Cancers review; lung TME crosstalk review) ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/3/384?utm_source=openai))  \nThis supports immune‑excluded or “myeloid‑inflamed” phenotypes with weak cytotoxic CD8 function.\n\n**TP53 and KRAS/TP53**\nAcross TCGA cancers, TP53 mutations correlate with higher leukocyte levels, suggesting a shift toward inflamed TIME in many contexts. (Thorsson et al., Immunity, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5982584/))  \nIn KRAS‑mutant LUAD, TP53 co‑mutation is often linked to higher PD‑L1 and CD8 infiltration signatures and IFN‑γ pathway activity, indicating a more “hot” phenotype in that context. (Recent KRAS immune‑regulation review) ([jeccr.biomedcentral.com](https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13046-025-03444-1?utm_source=openai))  \nBut TP53 effects are context‑dependent; in KRAS/TP53 PDAC models, co‑mutation can expand suppressive myeloid cells and dampen CD8 responses. (KRAS TIME review) ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223018565?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**CIN/Aneuploidy**\nHigh aneuploidy correlates with reduced cytotoxic immune markers (notably CD8) and immune evasion in pan‑cancer analyses. (Davoli et al., Science, 2017) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104840/?utm_source=openai))  \nCIN reprograms the TIME via IFN pathway loss, ENPP1‑adenosine accumulation, M2/Treg/MDSC enrichment, and NK/CD8 suppression; chronic STING activation can paradoxically drive exhaustion.

([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12514102/))  \n\n**Conflicting Evidence / Open Questions**\n- TMB/MMRd can be strongly inflamed yet still fail to sustain effective killing due to compensatory suppressive circuits (IDO1/CD38, neutrophils, Tregs). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n- CIN shows a dual effect: acute CIN can be immunogenic, while chronic CIN promotes immune exclusion and exhaustion; which balance dominates likely depends on tumor lineage and timing. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n- TP53’s immune impact is context‑specific: inflamed in some LUAD settings but myeloid‑suppressive in PDAC models. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223018565?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Summary**\nAcross tumors, MSI/MMRd and higher TMB generally drive immune‑inflamed TIME via neoantigens and cGAS‑STING signaling, enriching CD8 and NK cells, yet can still harbor suppressive feedback. STK11 and KEAP1 mutations are strong tumor‑intrinsic “cold” drivers, reducing DC and CD8 infiltration and favoring myeloid‑dominant, PD‑L1‑low milieus. KRAS signaling promotes immunosuppression via MHC‑I loss and Treg/MDSC recruitment, while TP53 co‑mutation can shift KRAS tumors toward inflamed phenotypes in LUAD but not uniformly across cancers. CIN/aneuploidy frequently dampens cytotoxic immunity through IFN‑pathway loss, ENPP1‑adenosine signaling, M2/Treg/MDSC accumulation, and NK/CD8 dysfunction, defining a mechanistic basis for immune‑excluded “cold” tumors.\n\n**Sources**\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/`\n- `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723013074`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763680/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104840/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5982584/`\n- `https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44318-025-00650-7`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450029/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12514102/`\n- `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223018565`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9457687/`",

These patterns are linked to distinct suppressive elements (MDSCs, Tregs, M2‑like TAMs) in excluded/desert states. ([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.1038/s44318-025-00650-7))\n\n**Key Findings With Specific Data Points**\n- MSI‑high CRC has markedly higher epithelial CD8+ T‑cell densities vs MSI‑low/MSS: ORs for CD3+CD8+ naïve, memory, and regulatory subsets are 3.49, 2.82, and 3.04, respectively; stromal CD3+CD4+ memory T cells are lower (OR 0.68). (Thomas et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763680/))  \n- STK11/LKB1‑mutant LUAD shows lower CD3+ and CD8+ T‑cell densities (P=0.0019 and P=0.0072), and STK11 alterations are enriched in PD‑L1‑negative tumors even with intermediate/high TMB (P<0.001). (Skoulidis et al., Cancer Discovery, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/))  \n- CIN‑high tumors show immunosuppressive remodeling: ENPP1 overexpression reduces CD8 and NK infiltration and decreases CD8/Treg ratio; chronic STING rewiring drives exhausted CD8 T cells and M2‑like macrophages with granulocytic MDSCs. (Requesens et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n\n**Genomic Features → TIME Mechanisms (CD8, Tregs, TAMs, MDSCs, NK)**\n**TMB/MSI/MMRd**\nHigh TMB/MMRd increases neoantigen load and cytosolic DNA sensing (cGAS‑STING), boosting CXCL10/CCL5 and IFN‑β to recruit and activate CD8 and NK cells and improve DC–T cell cross‑talk. This underpins immune‑inflamed phenotypes in MSI‑high tumors. (Requesens et al., Front Immunol, 2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \nSpatial transcriptomics shows MMRd CRC enriched for intratumoral immune hubs with activated T cells and chemokine‑expressing malignant/myeloid cells. (Pelka et al., Cell, 2021) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450029/?utm_source=openai))  \nImportant nuance: MSI‑high can still develop suppressive feedback (IDO1/CD38, neutrophils) despite being “hot,” indicating that hyper‑inflammation can coexist with immune brakes.

(Skoulidis et al., Cancer Discovery, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/))  \nMechanistically, LKB1 loss promotes neutrophil recruitment and suppressive cytokine programs that blunt T‑cell activity. (Koyama et al., 2016) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26833127/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**KEAP1/NRF2**\nKEAP1‑mutant LUAD suppresses CD103+ DC and CD8+ T‑cell responses; scRNA‑seq shows diminished DC/T‑cell activity, and NRF2 hyperactivation is causative. (Zavitsanou et al., Cell Reports, 2023) ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723013074))  \nNRF2 activation in macrophages can skew toward M2‑like programs (CD163/Arg1↑), linking KEAP1/NRF2 to TAM polarization and immunosuppression. (Wang et al., Cell Commun Signal, 2018) ([biosignaling.biomedcentral.com](https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-018-0262-x?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**KRAS**\nKRAS signaling can downregulate MHC‑I, increase IL‑10/TGF‑β, and recruit MDSCs, promoting Treg induction and TAM/MDSC‑dominant TIME. (Cancers review; lung TME crosstalk review) ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/3/384?utm_source=openai))  \nThis supports immune‑excluded or “myeloid‑inflamed” phenotypes with weak cytotoxic CD8 function.\n\n**TP53 and KRAS/TP53**\nAcross TCGA cancers, TP53 mutations correlate with higher leukocyte levels, suggesting a shift toward inflamed TIME in many contexts. (Thorsson et al., Immunity, 2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5982584/))  \nIn KRAS‑mutant LUAD, TP53 co‑mutation is often linked to higher PD‑L1 and CD8 infiltration signatures and IFN‑γ pathway activity, indicating a more “hot” phenotype in that context. (Recent KRAS immune‑regulation review) ([jeccr.biomedcentral.com](https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13046-025-03444-1?utm_source=openai))  \nBut TP53 effects are context‑dependent; in KRAS/TP53 PDAC models, co‑mutation can expand suppressive myeloid cells and dampen CD8 responses.

(Davoli et al., Science, 2017) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104840/?utm_source=openai))  \nCIN reprograms the TIME via IFN pathway loss, ENPP1‑adenosine accumulation, M2/Treg/MDSC enrichment, and NK/CD8 suppression; chronic STING activation can paradoxically drive exhaustion.

([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12514102/))  \n\n**Conflicting Evidence / Open Questions**\n- TMB/MMRd can be strongly inflamed yet still fail to sustain effective killing due to compensatory suppressive circuits (IDO1/CD38, neutrophils, Tregs). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n- CIN shows a dual effect: acute CIN can be immunogenic, while chronic CIN promotes immune exclusion and exhaustion; which balance dominates likely depends on tumor lineage and timing. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/))  \n- TP53’s immune impact is context‑specific: inflamed in some LUAD settings but myeloid‑suppressive in PDAC models. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223018565?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Summary**\nAcross tumors, MSI/MMRd and higher TMB generally drive immune‑inflamed TIME via neoantigens and cGAS‑STING signaling, enriching CD8 and NK cells, yet can still harbor suppressive feedback. STK11 and KEAP1 mutations are strong tumor‑intrinsic “cold” drivers, reducing DC and CD8 infiltration and favoring myeloid‑dominant, PD‑L1‑low milieus. KRAS signaling promotes immunosuppression via MHC‑I loss and Treg/MDSC recruitment, while TP53 co‑mutation can shift KRAS tumors toward inflamed phenotypes in LUAD but not uniformly across cancers. CIN/aneuploidy frequently dampens cytotoxic immunity through IFN‑pathway loss, ENPP1‑adenosine signaling, M2/Treg/MDSC accumulation, and NK/CD8 dysfunction, defining a mechanistic basis for immune‑excluded “cold” tumors.\n\n**Sources**\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6030433/`\n- `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723013074`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763680/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11562473/`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28104840/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5982584/`\n- `https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44318-025-00650-7`\n- `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450029/`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12514102/`\n- `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223018565`\n- `https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9457687/`"

([oncotarget.com](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/9414/text/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Checkpoint expression**  \n- **Inference**: High neoantigen load (from TMB/MSI) can drive chronic IFN signaling and T cell activation, indirectly increasing checkpoint receptor expression (CTLA‑4, LAG‑3, TIGIT) on T cells. This inference is grounded in the mechanistic link between antigen presentation and T‑cell activation, not a direct tumor‑cell transcriptional mechanism.  \n- **Direct tumor effect**: MSI‑linked JAK1/2 defects reduce IFNγ response, lowering IFN‑inducible PD‑L1 and MHC‑I. ([oncotarget.com](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/9414/text/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 2. CIN → cGAS–STING\n**Mechanistic impact on signaling**  \n- **Micronuclei sensing**: Genome instability creates micronuclei; their rupture recruits cGAS, activating STING and innate signaling. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **CIN‑driven pro‑metastatic signaling**: In CIN cells, cGAS–STING activates non‑canonical NF‑κB and promotes invasion/metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29342134/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **CIN‑dependent survival signaling**: cGAS–STING can drive IL‑6/STAT3 survival programs in CIN cancers (Nature 2022). ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04847-2))  \n\n**Impact on checkpoint ligands and antigen presentation**  \n- **NF‑κB/STAT3 link to PD‑L1**: NF‑κB and STAT3 are transcriptional regulators of PD‑L1 (mechanistically supported by autophagy/NF‑κB PD‑L1 induction and MAPK‑STAT3 PD‑L1 regulation in tumors). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925913/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Inference**: CIN‑driven chronic cGAS–STING signaling can elevate PD‑L1 via NF‑κB/STAT3, but context may skew toward immunosuppression or inflammation.  \n\n### 3. KRAS (G12C/D/V)\n**Structural and biochemical mechanism**  \n- Ras–RasGAP structure (`1WQ1`) shows GAP “arginine finger” and G12/Q61 geometry; G12 substitutions sterically disrupt GTPase activation, favoring GTP‑bound active KRAS. This applies to G12C/D/V. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1wq1?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Downstream signaling and immune effects**  \n- **MAPK/ERK → PD‑L1 transcription**: KRAS‑mutant lung cancers require MAPK for PD‑L1 expression; AP‑1 (c‑JUN) binds PD‑L1 enhancer, STAT3 partially contributes. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5112979/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **RAS → PD‑L1 mRNA stabilization**: Oncogenic RAS stabilizes PD‑L1 mRNA via AU‑rich elements; MEK/ERK inhibition reduces PD‑L1. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29246442/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **RAS → PI3K contribution**: MEK and PI3K both contribute to PD‑L1 protein levels (PI3K affects translation). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Antigen presentation suppression**: KRAS G12V signaling decreases TAP1, TAPBP, HLA‑A/B/C and B2M expression. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **ERK–autophagy axis**: In KRAS‑mutant iCCA, ERK inhibition lowers PD‑L1 by activating autophagy; tissue correlation p‑ERK vs PD‑L1 in 92 samples: Spearman r = 0.56, P < 0.0001. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305624/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 4. TP53 Hotspots (e.g., R175H, R248Q, R273H)\n**Structural mechanism**  \n- p53 core domain structure (`1TSR`) defines the DNA‑binding loops where hotspot mutations occur; these mutations disrupt sequence‑specific DNA binding. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1tsr?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Antigen presentation and PD‑L1**  \n- **MHC‑I**: p53 directly upregulates ERAP1, increasing MHC‑I surface expression. Loss of p53 reduces ERAP1 and MHC‑I. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **PD‑L1 via miR‑34**: p53 induces miR‑34; miR‑34 suppresses PD‑L1. p53 loss or mutation reduces miR‑34 and increases PD‑L1. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26577528/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 5. STK11 (LKB1) Loss\n**STING suppression and immune evasion**  \n- LKB1 loss in KRAS‑driven lung cancer is associated with transcriptional suppression of STING; in patient samples, LKB1 loss correlates with reduced STING protein (P < 0.0001). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Mechanism involves DNMT1/EZH2‑linked silencing, dampening type‑I IFN programs and lowering immune recruitment/PD‑L1. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 6. KEAP1/NRF2 Alterations\n**PD‑L1 protein stability**  \n- KEAP1 can ubiquitinate PD‑L1 (K48‑linked) and promote PD‑L1 degradation; KEAP1 loss stabilizes PD‑L1 protein. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899596/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Antigen presentation and STING**  \n- NRF2‑activated tumors show reduced expression of MHC‑I antigen‑presentation genes (immunoediting signature). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37839356/?utm_source=openai))  \n- NRF2 can suppress STING pathway activity in KRAS/KEAP1‑co‑mutant NSCLC. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492744/?utm_source=openai))  \n- KEAP1 and CUL3 are required for IFNγ‑induced MHC‑II expression in a genetic/chemical screen. ([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.201745553?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Signaling Integration Map (Mechanistic Links)\n- **MAPK/ERK**: KRAS activation → AP‑1/ERK → PD‑L1 transcription; ERK also stabilizes PD‑L1 via autophagy suppression. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5112979/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **PI3K/AKT/mTOR**: RAS–PI3K contributes to PD‑L1 protein expression (translation). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **JAK‑STAT**: IFNγ → JAK2 → IRF1 → HLA‑ABC; JAK2 loss blocks this. MSI‑linked JAK1 frameshifts also impair MHC‑I induction. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5617399/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **cGAS‑STING**: CIN → micronuclei rupture → cGAS/STING → NF‑κB, type‑I IFN, IL‑6/STAT3 programs; LKB1 and NRF2 can suppress this axis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Conflicting Evidence / Open Questions\n- **KEAP1/NRF2 and PD‑L1**: KEAP1 promotes PD‑L1 degradation (suggesting KEAP1 loss increases PD‑L1), yet NRF2‑activated tumors show reduced MHC‑I gene expression and broader immunoediting; the net checkpoint phenotype likely depends on tissue and cytokine context. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899596/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **cGAS‑STING in CIN**: Acute activation can enhance immune surveillance (type‑I IFN), but chronic CIN can drive NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 pro‑survival and metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **TIM‑3 ligands**: Structural evidence suggests a galectin‑9‑independent binding surface, leaving physiological ligand usage context‑dependent. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761307001781?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Most Significant Findings (Summary)\n1. **KRAS G12C/D/V** lock KRAS in active signaling states via impaired GAP‑mediated hydrolysis, driving MAPK/ERK‑ and PI3K‑dependent PD‑L1 upregulation and reducing antigen presentation genes (TAP1, HLA‑A/B/C, B2M). ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1wq1?utm_source=openai))  \n2. **TP53 loss/hotspots** reduce MHC‑I via ERAP1 downregulation and elevate PD‑L1 through loss of miR‑34, tying genome integrity to antigen processing and checkpoint control. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n3. **STK11/LKB1 loss** epigenetically silences STING, dampening DNA‑sensing and IFN programs that normally support antigen presentation and checkpoint induction. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n4. **CIN activates cGAS–STING** via micronuclei, but chronic signaling can switch to NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 programs that support immune evasion and metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n5. **MSI generates frameshift neoantigens** but also selects for antigen‑presentation loss (B2M, JAK1), creating a balance of high neoantigen load and immune escape. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27467916/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Databases / Resources Consulted\n- **RCSB PDB** for checkpoint and core signaling protein structures (`4ZQK`, `1I8L`, `3UDW`, `9BF9`, `6DHB`, `1WQ1`, `1TSR`). ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4zqk?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Primary literature repositories**: PubMed/PMC for mechanistic and structural biology papers cited above. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can map these mechanisms onto a signaling diagram (textual or figure-ready) or drill into one pathway (e.g., KRAS→PD‑L1 regulation) with residue‑level details and specific motifs.",

            "text": "I’ll use the **web-search** skill and rely only on primary sources (research papers and PDB entries), as required.\n\n**Framing (Checkpoint “Ligands” vs Receptors)**  \nPD‑L1 is a ligand; CTLA‑4, LAG‑3, and TIGIT are receptors. I interpret your request as mechanisms that control expression of these checkpoint molecules (ligands or receptors) and how antigen presentation and signaling shifts alter their engagement. Where I infer indirect effects (e.g., antigen presentation shaping receptor expression on T cells), I label it explicitly as inference.\n\n**Structural Context: Checkpoint Interfaces (PDB IDs)**  \nThese structures anchor the biochemical interaction surfaces that are affected by changes in expression.  \n- PD‑1/PD‑L1: `4ZQK` (X‑ray, 2.45 Å) defines the PD‑1–PD‑L1 interface and receptor plasticity. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4zqk?utm_source=openai))  \n- CTLA‑4/B7‑1: `1I8L` (X‑ray, 3.0 Å) shows CTLA‑4 homodimerization and bivalent B7‑1 binding. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1I8L?utm_source=openai))  \n- TIGIT/CD155: `3UDW` (X‑ray) shows TIGIT–PVR (CD155) lock‑and‑key interface and cis/trans clustering. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3UDW?utm_source=openai))  \n- LAG‑3/HLA‑DR1: `9BF9` (X‑ray, 3.40 Å; 2024) shows LAG‑3 dimer engaging two MHC‑II molecules. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/9bf9?utm_source=openai))  \n- TIM‑3 IgV domain: `6DHB` (X‑ray) provides the TIM‑3 IgV fold; earlier structural work indicates a galectin‑9‑independent binding surface. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6DHB?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Core Antigen Presentation Regulators (MHC‑I and MHC‑II)**  \n- **MHC‑I transcriptional control**: NLRC5 is a class‑I transactivator; loss reduces MHC‑I expression. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22490867/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **IFNγ–JAK–IRF1 axis**: JAK2 loss blocks IFNγ‑induced IRF1 and HLA‑ABC upregulation in NSCLC. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5617399/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **MHC‑II control**: IFNγ‑induced MHC‑II depends on KEAP1/CUL3 and chromatin regulators (EMBO reports). ([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.201745553?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Mechanisms by Alteration\n\n### 1. TMB/MSI\n**Mechanistic impact on antigen presentation**  \n- **MSI generates frameshift neoantigens**: MSI produces frameshift peptides (FSPs) that can elicit tumor‑specific CD8 responses. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27467916/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Antigen presentation escape in MSI**: B2M (β2‑microglobulin) is frequently mutated in MSI‑H tumors, disrupting MHC‑I surface expression. Data point: MSI‑H CRC shows B2M mutation in 57.5% (23/40), with lower rates in MSI‑H GC (23.9%) and EC (13.6%). ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/28/3/e136/7022155?utm_source=openai))  \n- **IFN pathway escape in MSI**: MSI‑derived JAK1 frameshift mutations impair IFNγ‑induced MHC‑I pathway genes (e.g., LMP7, HLA class I). ([oncotarget.com](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/9414/text/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Checkpoint expression**  \n- **Inference**: High neoantigen load (from TMB/MSI) can drive chronic IFN signaling and T cell activation, indirectly increasing checkpoint receptor expression (CTLA‑4, LAG‑3, TIGIT) on T cells. This inference is grounded in the mechanistic link between antigen presentation and T‑cell activation, not a direct tumor‑cell transcriptional mechanism.  \n- **Direct tumor effect**: MSI‑linked JAK1/2 defects reduce IFNγ response, lowering IFN‑inducible PD‑L1 and MHC‑I. ([oncotarget.com](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/9414/text/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 2. CIN → cGAS–STING\n**Mechanistic impact on signaling**  \n- **Micronuclei sensing**: Genome instability creates micronuclei; their rupture recruits cGAS, activating STING and innate signaling. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **CIN‑driven pro‑metastatic signaling**: In CIN cells, cGAS–STING activates non‑canonical NF‑κB and promotes invasion/metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29342134/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **CIN‑dependent survival signaling**: cGAS–STING can drive IL‑6/STAT3 survival programs in CIN cancers (Nature 2022). ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04847-2))  \n\n**Impact on checkpoint ligands and antigen presentation**  \n- **NF‑κB/STAT3 link to PD‑L1**: NF‑κB and STAT3 are transcriptional regulators of PD‑L1 (mechanistically supported by autophagy/NF‑κB PD‑L1 induction and MAPK‑STAT3 PD‑L1 regulation in tumors). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925913/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Inference**: CIN‑driven chronic cGAS–STING signaling can elevate PD‑L1 via NF‑κB/STAT3, but context may skew toward immunosuppression or inflammation.  \n\n### 3. KRAS (G12C/D/V)\n**Structural and biochemical mechanism**  \n- Ras–RasGAP structure (`1WQ1`) shows GAP “arginine finger” and G12/Q61 geometry; G12 substitutions sterically disrupt GTPase activation, favoring GTP‑bound active KRAS. This applies to G12C/D/V. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1wq1?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Downstream signaling and immune effects**  \n- **MAPK/ERK → PD‑L1 transcription**: KRAS‑mutant lung cancers require MAPK for PD‑L1 expression; AP‑1 (c‑JUN) binds PD‑L1 enhancer, STAT3 partially contributes. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5112979/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **RAS → PD‑L1 mRNA stabilization**: Oncogenic RAS stabilizes PD‑L1 mRNA via AU‑rich elements; MEK/ERK inhibition reduces PD‑L1. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29246442/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **RAS → PI3K contribution**: MEK and PI3K both contribute to PD‑L1 protein levels (PI3K affects translation). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Antigen presentation suppression**: KRAS G12V signaling decreases TAP1, TAPBP, HLA‑A/B/C and B2M expression. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **ERK–autophagy axis**: In KRAS‑mutant iCCA, ERK inhibition lowers PD‑L1 by activating autophagy; tissue correlation p‑ERK vs PD‑L1 in 92 samples: Spearman r = 0.56, P < 0.0001. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305624/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 4. TP53 Hotspots (e.g., R175H, R248Q, R273H)\n**Structural mechanism**  \n- p53 core domain structure (`1TSR`) defines the DNA‑binding loops where hotspot mutations occur; these mutations disrupt sequence‑specific DNA binding. ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1tsr?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Antigen presentation and PD‑L1**  \n- **MHC‑I**: p53 directly upregulates ERAP1, increasing MHC‑I surface expression. Loss of p53 reduces ERAP1 and MHC‑I. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **PD‑L1 via miR‑34**: p53 induces miR‑34; miR‑34 suppresses PD‑L1. p53 loss or mutation reduces miR‑34 and increases PD‑L1. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26577528/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 5. STK11 (LKB1) Loss\n**STING suppression and immune evasion**  \n- LKB1 loss in KRAS‑driven lung cancer is associated with transcriptional suppression of STING; in patient samples, LKB1 loss correlates with reduced STING protein (P < 0.0001). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n- Mechanism involves DNMT1/EZH2‑linked silencing, dampening type‑I IFN programs and lowering immune recruitment/PD‑L1. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n### 6. KEAP1/NRF2 Alterations\n**PD‑L1 protein stability**  \n- KEAP1 can ubiquitinate PD‑L1 (K48‑linked) and promote PD‑L1 degradation; KEAP1 loss stabilizes PD‑L1 protein. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899596/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Antigen presentation and STING**  \n- NRF2‑activated tumors show reduced expression of MHC‑I antigen‑presentation genes (immunoediting signature). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37839356/?utm_source=openai))  \n- NRF2 can suppress STING pathway activity in KRAS/KEAP1‑co‑mutant NSCLC. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492744/?utm_source=openai))  \n- KEAP1 and CUL3 are required for IFNγ‑induced MHC‑II expression in a genetic/chemical screen. ([embopress.org](https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.15252/embr.201745553?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Signaling Integration Map (Mechanistic Links)\n- **MAPK/ERK**: KRAS activation → AP‑1/ERK → PD‑L1 transcription; ERK also stabilizes PD‑L1 via autophagy suppression. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5112979/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **PI3K/AKT/mTOR**: RAS–PI3K contributes to PD‑L1 protein expression (translation). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5746170/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **JAK‑STAT**: IFNγ → JAK2 → IRF1 → HLA‑ABC; JAK2 loss blocks this. MSI‑linked JAK1 frameshifts also impair MHC‑I induction. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5617399/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **cGAS‑STING**: CIN → micronuclei rupture → cGAS/STING → NF‑κB, type‑I IFN, IL‑6/STAT3 programs; LKB1 and NRF2 can suppress this axis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Conflicting Evidence / Open Questions\n- **KEAP1/NRF2 and PD‑L1**: KEAP1 promotes PD‑L1 degradation (suggesting KEAP1 loss increases PD‑L1), yet NRF2‑activated tumors show reduced MHC‑I gene expression and broader immunoediting; the net checkpoint phenotype likely depends on tissue and cytokine context. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899596/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **cGAS‑STING in CIN**: Acute activation can enhance immune surveillance (type‑I IFN), but chronic CIN can drive NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 pro‑survival and metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **TIM‑3 ligands**: Structural evidence suggests a galectin‑9‑independent binding surface, leaving physiological ligand usage context‑dependent. ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761307001781?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Most Significant Findings (Summary)\n1. **KRAS G12C/D/V** lock KRAS in active signaling states via impaired GAP‑mediated hydrolysis, driving MAPK/ERK‑ and PI3K‑dependent PD‑L1 upregulation and reducing antigen presentation genes (TAP1, HLA‑A/B/C, B2M). ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1wq1?utm_source=openai))  \n2. **TP53 loss/hotspots** reduce MHC‑I via ERAP1 downregulation and elevate PD‑L1 through loss of miR‑34, tying genome integrity to antigen processing and checkpoint control. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n3. **STK11/LKB1 loss** epigenetically silences STING, dampening DNA‑sensing and IFN programs that normally support antigen presentation and checkpoint induction. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6328329/?utm_source=openai))  \n4. **CIN activates cGAS–STING** via micronuclei, but chronic signaling can switch to NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 programs that support immune evasion and metastasis. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738408/?utm_source=openai))  \n5. **MSI generates frameshift neoantigens** but also selects for antigen‑presentation loss (B2M, JAK1), creating a balance of high neoantigen load and immune escape. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27467916/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Databases / Resources Consulted\n- **RCSB PDB** for checkpoint and core signaling protein structures (`4ZQK`, `1I8L`, `3UDW`, `9BF9`, `6DHB`, `1WQ1`, `1TSR`). ([rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4zqk?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Primary literature repositories**: PubMed/PMC for mechanistic and structural biology papers cited above. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23965983/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can map these mechanisms onto a signaling diagram (textual or figure-ready) or drill into one pathway (e.g., KRAS→PD‑L1 regulation) with residue‑level details and specific motifs."

      "output": "**I. Executive Summary**\n- Pan‑cancer data show distinct distributions of TMB, MSI‑H, and CIN by tumor type, with melanoma and smoking‑associated lung cancers enriched for high TMB; endometrioid endometrial, small intestine, colorectal, and gastric cancers enriched for MSI‑H; and CIN highest in TGCT/ESCA/ACC/OV and high in both LUAD/LUSC. These genomic strata set the baseline likelihood of immune‑inflamed versus immune‑excluded phenotypes.\n- MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB tumors generate abundant neoantigens and activate cGAS–STING/IFN programs that support antigen presentation and CD8/NK recruitment, yet frequently acquire immune‑escape mutations (e.g., B2M, JAK1) that blunt MHC‑I and IFN signaling.\n- Driver mutations shape checkpoint biology at the molecular level: KRAS activates MAPK/ERK and PI3K to raise PD‑L1 and suppress antigen presentation; TP53 loss reduces ERAP1/MHC‑I and lifts PD‑L1 via miR‑34 loss; STK11/LKB1 silences STING and dampens IFN programs; KEAP1/NRF2 alters PD‑L1 stability and antigen‑presentation gene expression.\n- Tumor‑intrinsic genotypes map to distinct TIME states: MSI‑H/dMMR is typically “hot”; STK11 and KEAP1 alterations drive “cold” phenotypes with low CD8 infiltration; CIN skews toward myeloid‑dominant, exhausted, or excluded states despite innate sensing.\n- Clinical trials 2023–2025 support biomarker‑driven strategies: dual ICI in MSI‑H/dMMR mCRC (CheckMate 8HW) and TMB‑H tumors (CheckMate 848); CTLA‑4 add‑on for STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC (POSEIDON biomarker analysis); KRAS G12C targeted + PD‑1 strategies in NSCLC (KRYSTAL‑7); and neoantigen vaccines or TIL therapy combined with PD‑1 blockade.\n- Major gaps include harmonizing TMB and CIN assays, prospective TP53‑stratified outcomes, and resolving chronic cGAS–STING signaling’s dual immunogenic and immunosuppressive roles.\n\n---\n\n**II. Integrated Analysis (Genome → Protein → TIME → Clinical Outcomes)**\n\n**Genomic landscape across major cancers**\nLarge-scale pan‑cancer datasets define how immune‑relevant genomic features distribute by tumor type. TMB peaks in SKCM (49.4%), LUAD (36.9%), and LUSC (28.1%), with intermediate‑high rates in BLCA, UCEC, COAD, STAD, DLBC, HNSC, ESCA, PAAD, and CESC; very low rates occur in THYM, PRAD, KIRC, KIRP, LAML, OV, PCPG, and THCA. MSI‑H prevalence is overall 2.4% across 174,166 tumors, with the highest rates in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (32%), small intestine adenocarcinoma (10%), CRC (7%), and gastric cancer (6%). CIN, quantified by allelic imbalance burden, is highest in TGCT/ESCA/ACC/OV and remains high in LUAD/LUSC. Driver mutation frequencies show tumor‑type enrichment: KRAS is dominant in pancreas (81.5%) and CRC (48.9%); TP53 is high in LUSC (74.9%) and substantial in LUAD (45.6%) and CRC (51% overall; 81% in metastatic CRC); STK11 (16.82%) and KEAP1 (14.35%) are LUAD‑enriched.\n\nThese distributions establish the first layer of immune “predisposition.” Tumors with high TMB or MSI‑H are more likely to be immunogenic, whereas CIN‑high cancers often show immune evasion despite innate sensing signals.\n\n**Molecular mechanisms linking genotype to antigen presentation and checkpoint biology**\nAt the protein level, genomic lesions regulate antigen presentation and checkpoint ligand/receptor engagement through defined signaling axes and biochemical mechanisms.\n\n- **TMB/MSI → antigen load and escape**: MSI creates frameshift peptides that can be highly immunogenic, but MSI‑H tumors frequently acquire antigen‑presentation escape: B2M mutations are common in MSI‑H CRC (57.5%) and less frequent in MSI‑H gastric (23.9%) and endometrial (13.6%) cancers. MSI‑linked JAK1 frameshifts blunt IFNγ‑induced MHC‑I genes, reducing IFN‑inducible PD‑L1 and antigen presentation.\n- **KRAS → MAPK/ERK and PI3K effects**: Structural data (RAS–RasGAP, `1WQ1`) show how G12 substitutions lock KRAS in the active GTP‑bound state. In KRAS‑mutant lung cancers, MAPK/ERK signaling drives PD‑L1 transcription through AP‑1; PI3K contributes to PD‑L1 protein expression. KRAS G12V suppresses antigen presentation genes (TAP1, TAPBP, HLA‑A/B/C, B2M), reducing MHC‑I presentation.\n- **TP53 loss → MHC‑I down, PD‑L1 up**: p53 directly upregulates ERAP1, increasing MHC‑I presentation. p53 loss or hotspot mutations reduce ERAP1 and thus MHC‑I. p53 also induces miR‑34, which suppresses PD‑L1; loss of p53 increases PD‑L1.\n- **STK11/LKB1 loss → STING silencing**: LKB1 loss suppresses STING expression via epigenetic repression (DNMT1/EZH2), limiting type‑I IFN responses and reducing antigen presentation and PD‑L1 induction.\n- **KEAP1/NRF2 axis → PD‑L1 stability and immunoediting**: KEAP1 ubiquitinates PD‑L1 for proteasomal degradation; KEAP1 loss stabilizes PD‑L1 protein. NRF2 activation is associated with reduced MHC‑I antigen presentation gene expression and STING suppression in KRAS/KEAP1 co‑mutant NSCLC.\n- **CIN → cGAS–STING with dual outputs**: CIN generates micronuclei that activate cGAS–STING, driving type‑I IFN and NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 programs. Acute activation can be immunostimulatory; chronic activation shifts toward pro‑survival, pro‑metastatic signaling and may raise PD‑L1 via NF‑κB/STAT3.\n\n**TIME composition and pathological patterns**\nThese molecular programs converge on characteristic TIME states.\n\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB**: High neoantigen load and active cGAS–STING/IFN programs promote immune‑inflamed (“hot”) tumors with CD8+ infiltration and DC–T cell interactions. In MSI‑H CRC, epithelial CD8+ T‑cell densities are substantially higher (ORs 2.82–3.49 across CD8 subsets), consistent with inflamed pathology. Yet MSI‑H tumors can still develop suppressive feedback (e.g., IDO1/CD38, neutrophils), creating inflamed but functionally constrained states.\n- **STK11/LKB1 and KEAP1**: STK11 loss yields PD‑L1‑low, non‑T‑cell‑inflamed LUAD with reduced CD3/CD8 densities. KEAP1/NRF2 hyperactivation suppresses CD103+ DCs and CD8 responses, and macrophage polarization toward M2‑like states has been reported with NRF2 activation.\n- **KRAS**: KRAS signaling can downregulate MHC‑I and recruit suppressive myeloid populations (MDSCs, M2‑like TAMs), driving immune‑excluded or myeloid‑inflamed phenotypes with weak cytotoxic function.\n- **TP53 context dependence**: Pan‑cancer analyses link TP53 mutations to higher leukocyte signals overall, but in specific contexts (e.g., KRAS/TP53 PDAC models) co‑mutation expands suppressive myeloid cells and dampens CD8 responses.\n- **CIN/Aneuploidy**: CIN is associated with reduced cytotoxic immune markers and immune evasion in pan‑cancer studies. Mechanistically, ENPP1‑adenosine signaling, M2/Treg/MDSC enrichment, and NK/CD8 suppression contribute to immune exclusion. Chronic STING activation can exhaust CD8 T cells and enrich suppressive myeloid cells.\n\n**Clinical outcomes and biomarker‑aligned trials (2023–2025)**\nThe clinical data reflect these mechanistic patterns.\n\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR mCRC**: CheckMate 8HW shows PFS improvement with nivolumab+ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone (HR 0.62; median PFS not reached vs 39.3 months at 47‑month follow‑up). FDA approval followed in May 2025. These outcomes align with the inflamed TIME and high neoantigen burden of MSI‑H tumors.\n- **TMB‑high tumors**: CheckMate 848 demonstrates higher ORR with nivolumab+ipilimumab vs nivolumab alone in tTMB‑H (38.6% vs 29.8%) and bTMB‑H (22.5% vs 15.6%) cohorts, supporting dual ICI in high‑neoantigen settings.\n- **STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC**: POSEIDON biomarker analysis indicates improved ORR and OS with durvalumab+tremelimumab+chemo in STK11/KEAP1‑mutant tumors (OS HR ~0.50; median OS 15.8 months vs 7.3 months for durvalumab+chemo), consistent with rescuing “cold” TIME via CTLA‑4 add‑on.\n- **KRAS G12C NSCLC**: KRYSTAL‑7 shows encouraging ORR (~44% overall) for adagrasib+pembrolizumab, with activity across PD‑L1 subgroups, reflecting the need to counteract KRAS‑driven immunosuppression with combined targeted and immune therapy.\n- **Neoantigen vaccines and cellular therapies**: KEYNOTE‑942 (mRNA‑4157/V940 + pembrolizumab) improved RFS (HR 0.561) in adjuvant melanoma. Lifileucel (TIL therapy) gained FDA accelerated approval in 2024 for PD‑1‑refractory melanoma (ORR 31.5%). These approaches leverage neoantigen presentation and T‑cell reinvigoration.\n\n---\n\n**III. Translational Implications**\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB**: Robust antigenicity and T‑cell infiltration predict benefit from dual ICI. However, frequent B2M/JAK1 defects justify integrating antigen‑presentation assays into clinical decision‑making and testing salvage strategies (e.g., NK‑cell‑directed approaches or bispecifics).\n- **STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC**: Mechanistic evidence for STING silencing and DC/T‑cell exclusion aligns with clinical benefit from CTLA‑4 add‑on. This defines a true biomarker‑driven subgroup where “immune‑cold” genotypes can be re‑sensitized.\n- **KRAS‑mutant tumors**: MAPK/ERK‑driven PD‑L1 upregulation and antigen‑presentation suppression argue for rational combination of KRAS inhibitors with PD‑1 blockade, potentially with agents that restore MHC‑I (e.g., IFN pathway agonists).\n- **CIN‑high tumors**: CIN‑induced chronic STING signaling can yield immunosuppressive myeloid states. Combinations pairing ICI with agents that modulate STING, adenosine pathways (ENPP1/CD73), or myeloid checkpoints are translationally logical but remain under‑tested.\n- **TP53‑altered tumors**: Loss of miR‑34‑mediated PD‑L1 suppression and ERAP1‑dependent MHC‑I suggests therapeutic windows for PD‑1 blockade plus agents that restore antigen processing or mimic miR‑34.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Key Challenges and Knowledge Gaps**\n- **Assay harmonization**: TMB and CIN thresholds differ across platforms (tTMB vs bTMB; AI burden vs aneuploidy), limiting cross‑trial comparability.\n- **Context‑dependent immune phenotypes**: TP53 and CIN have divergent immune effects by tissue context and timing (acute vs chronic cGAS–STING), complicating biomarker‑based stratification.\n- **Antigen‑presentation escape**: High‑TMB/MSI tumors commonly acquire B2M/JAK1 defects; clinical pathways to detect and overcome these are not standardized.\n- **Checkpoint selection**: TIGIT has failed in phase 3 NSCLC trials, indicating incomplete biomarker strategy or patient selection.\n- **Prospective genotype‑stratified trials**: Aside from MSI‑H/dMMR and emerging STK11/KEAP1 data, few trials are prospectively powered for driver‑defined immune outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**V. Future Directions**\n1. **Prospective, genotype‑stratified trials**: Power studies for STK11/KEAP1, TP53, and CIN‑high cohorts with defined immune endpoints.\n2. **Integrated biomarker panels**: Combine TMB/MSI with antigen‑presentation integrity (B2M/JAK1), IFN signatures, and myeloid markers to refine ICI selection.\n3. **Mechanism‑guided combinations**:  \n   - KRAS‑mutant: KRAS inhibitor + PD‑1 + antigen‑presentation restoration (e.g., IFN pathway agonists).  \n   - CIN‑high: ICI + adenosine‑pathway blockade or STING modulators; integrate radiation where CIN suggests innate sensing.\n4. **Spatial and single‑cell TIME mapping**: Expand spatial transcriptomics across tumor types to link genotype to immune‑cell localization and functional states.\n5. **Neoantigen‑driven therapies**: Move personalized vaccines and TILs into earlier lines for high‑TMB and MSI‑H disease, with monitoring for antigen‑presentation loss.\n\n---\n\n**VI.

            "text": "**I. Executive Summary**\n- Pan‑cancer data show distinct distributions of TMB, MSI‑H, and CIN by tumor type, with melanoma and smoking‑associated lung cancers enriched for high TMB; endometrioid endometrial, small intestine, colorectal, and gastric cancers enriched for MSI‑H; and CIN highest in TGCT/ESCA/ACC/OV and high in both LUAD/LUSC. These genomic strata set the baseline likelihood of immune‑inflamed versus immune‑excluded phenotypes.\n- MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB tumors generate abundant neoantigens and activate cGAS–STING/IFN programs that support antigen presentation and CD8/NK recruitment, yet frequently acquire immune‑escape mutations (e.g., B2M, JAK1) that blunt MHC‑I and IFN signaling.\n- Driver mutations shape checkpoint biology at the molecular level: KRAS activates MAPK/ERK and PI3K to raise PD‑L1 and suppress antigen presentation; TP53 loss reduces ERAP1/MHC‑I and lifts PD‑L1 via miR‑34 loss; STK11/LKB1 silences STING and dampens IFN programs; KEAP1/NRF2 alters PD‑L1 stability and antigen‑presentation gene expression.\n- Tumor‑intrinsic genotypes map to distinct TIME states: MSI‑H/dMMR is typically “hot”; STK11 and KEAP1 alterations drive “cold” phenotypes with low CD8 infiltration; CIN skews toward myeloid‑dominant, exhausted, or excluded states despite innate sensing.\n- Clinical trials 2023–2025 support biomarker‑driven strategies: dual ICI in MSI‑H/dMMR mCRC (CheckMate 8HW) and TMB‑H tumors (CheckMate 848); CTLA‑4 add‑on for STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC (POSEIDON biomarker analysis); KRAS G12C targeted + PD‑1 strategies in NSCLC (KRYSTAL‑7); and neoantigen vaccines or TIL therapy combined with PD‑1 blockade.\n- Major gaps include harmonizing TMB and CIN assays, prospective TP53‑stratified outcomes, and resolving chronic cGAS–STING signaling’s dual immunogenic and immunosuppressive roles.\n\n---\n\n**II. Integrated Analysis (Genome → Protein → TIME → Clinical Outcomes)**\n\n**Genomic landscape across major cancers**\nLarge-scale pan‑cancer datasets define how immune‑relevant genomic features distribute by tumor type. TMB peaks in SKCM (49.4%), LUAD (36.9%), and LUSC (28.1%), with intermediate‑high rates in BLCA, UCEC, COAD, STAD, DLBC, HNSC, ESCA, PAAD, and CESC; very low rates occur in THYM, PRAD, KIRC, KIRP, LAML, OV, PCPG, and THCA. MSI‑H prevalence is overall 2.4% across 174,166 tumors, with the highest rates in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (32%), small intestine adenocarcinoma (10%), CRC (7%), and gastric cancer (6%). CIN, quantified by allelic imbalance burden, is highest in TGCT/ESCA/ACC/OV and remains high in LUAD/LUSC. Driver mutation frequencies show tumor‑type enrichment: KRAS is dominant in pancreas (81.5%) and CRC (48.9%); TP53 is high in LUSC (74.9%) and substantial in LUAD (45.6%) and CRC (51% overall; 81% in metastatic CRC); STK11 (16.82%) and KEAP1 (14.35%) are LUAD‑enriched.\n\nThese distributions establish the first layer of immune “predisposition.” Tumors with high TMB or MSI‑H are more likely to be immunogenic, whereas CIN‑high cancers often show immune evasion despite innate sensing signals.\n\n**Molecular mechanisms linking genotype to antigen presentation and checkpoint biology**\nAt the protein level, genomic lesions regulate antigen presentation and checkpoint ligand/receptor engagement through defined signaling axes and biochemical mechanisms.\n\n- **TMB/MSI → antigen load and escape**: MSI creates frameshift peptides that can be highly immunogenic, but MSI‑H tumors frequently acquire antigen‑presentation escape: B2M mutations are common in MSI‑H CRC (57.5%) and less frequent in MSI‑H gastric (23.9%) and endometrial (13.6%) cancers. MSI‑linked JAK1 frameshifts blunt IFNγ‑induced MHC‑I genes, reducing IFN‑inducible PD‑L1 and antigen presentation.\n- **KRAS → MAPK/ERK and PI3K effects**: Structural data (RAS–RasGAP, `1WQ1`) show how G12 substitutions lock KRAS in the active GTP‑bound state. In KRAS‑mutant lung cancers, MAPK/ERK signaling drives PD‑L1 transcription through AP‑1; PI3K contributes to PD‑L1 protein expression. KRAS G12V suppresses antigen presentation genes (TAP1, TAPBP, HLA‑A/B/C, B2M), reducing MHC‑I presentation.\n- **TP53 loss → MHC‑I down, PD‑L1 up**: p53 directly upregulates ERAP1, increasing MHC‑I presentation. p53 loss or hotspot mutations reduce ERAP1 and thus MHC‑I. p53 also induces miR‑34, which suppresses PD‑L1; loss of p53 increases PD‑L1.\n- **STK11/LKB1 loss → STING silencing**: LKB1 loss suppresses STING expression via epigenetic repression (DNMT1/EZH2), limiting type‑I IFN responses and reducing antigen presentation and PD‑L1 induction.\n- **KEAP1/NRF2 axis → PD‑L1 stability and immunoediting**: KEAP1 ubiquitinates PD‑L1 for proteasomal degradation; KEAP1 loss stabilizes PD‑L1 protein. NRF2 activation is associated with reduced MHC‑I antigen presentation gene expression and STING suppression in KRAS/KEAP1 co‑mutant NSCLC.\n- **CIN → cGAS–STING with dual outputs**: CIN generates micronuclei that activate cGAS–STING, driving type‑I IFN and NF‑κB/IL‑6/STAT3 programs. Acute activation can be immunostimulatory; chronic activation shifts toward pro‑survival, pro‑metastatic signaling and may raise PD‑L1 via NF‑κB/STAT3.\n\n**TIME composition and pathological patterns**\nThese molecular programs converge on characteristic TIME states.\n\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB**: High neoantigen load and active cGAS–STING/IFN programs promote immune‑inflamed (“hot”) tumors with CD8+ infiltration and DC–T cell interactions. In MSI‑H CRC, epithelial CD8+ T‑cell densities are substantially higher (ORs 2.82–3.49 across CD8 subsets), consistent with inflamed pathology. Yet MSI‑H tumors can still develop suppressive feedback (e.g., IDO1/CD38, neutrophils), creating inflamed but functionally constrained states.\n- **STK11/LKB1 and KEAP1**: STK11 loss yields PD‑L1‑low, non‑T‑cell‑inflamed LUAD with reduced CD3/CD8 densities. KEAP1/NRF2 hyperactivation suppresses CD103+ DCs and CD8 responses, and macrophage polarization toward M2‑like states has been reported with NRF2 activation.\n- **KRAS**: KRAS signaling can downregulate MHC‑I and recruit suppressive myeloid populations (MDSCs, M2‑like TAMs), driving immune‑excluded or myeloid‑inflamed phenotypes with weak cytotoxic function.\n- **TP53 context dependence**: Pan‑cancer analyses link TP53 mutations to higher leukocyte signals overall, but in specific contexts (e.g., KRAS/TP53 PDAC models) co‑mutation expands suppressive myeloid cells and dampens CD8 responses.\n- **CIN/Aneuploidy**: CIN is associated with reduced cytotoxic immune markers and immune evasion in pan‑cancer studies. Mechanistically, ENPP1‑adenosine signaling, M2/Treg/MDSC enrichment, and NK/CD8 suppression contribute to immune exclusion. Chronic STING activation can exhaust CD8 T cells and enrich suppressive myeloid cells.\n\n**Clinical outcomes and biomarker‑aligned trials (2023–2025)**\nThe clinical data reflect these mechanistic patterns.\n\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR mCRC**: CheckMate 8HW shows PFS improvement with nivolumab+ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone (HR 0.62; median PFS not reached vs 39.3 months at 47‑month follow‑up). FDA approval followed in May 2025. These outcomes align with the inflamed TIME and high neoantigen burden of MSI‑H tumors.\n- **TMB‑high tumors**: CheckMate 848 demonstrates higher ORR with nivolumab+ipilimumab vs nivolumab alone in tTMB‑H (38.6% vs 29.8%) and bTMB‑H (22.5% vs 15.6%) cohorts, supporting dual ICI in high‑neoantigen settings.\n- **STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC**: POSEIDON biomarker analysis indicates improved ORR and OS with durvalumab+tremelimumab+chemo in STK11/KEAP1‑mutant tumors (OS HR ~0.50; median OS 15.8 months vs 7.3 months for durvalumab+chemo), consistent with rescuing “cold” TIME via CTLA‑4 add‑on.\n- **KRAS G12C NSCLC**: KRYSTAL‑7 shows encouraging ORR (~44% overall) for adagrasib+pembrolizumab, with activity across PD‑L1 subgroups, reflecting the need to counteract KRAS‑driven immunosuppression with combined targeted and immune therapy.\n- **Neoantigen vaccines and cellular therapies**: KEYNOTE‑942 (mRNA‑4157/V940 + pembrolizumab) improved RFS (HR 0.561) in adjuvant melanoma. Lifileucel (TIL therapy) gained FDA accelerated approval in 2024 for PD‑1‑refractory melanoma (ORR 31.5%). These approaches leverage neoantigen presentation and T‑cell reinvigoration.\n\n---\n\n**III. Translational Implications**\n- **MSI‑H/dMMR and high‑TMB**: Robust antigenicity and T‑cell infiltration predict benefit from dual ICI. However, frequent B2M/JAK1 defects justify integrating antigen‑presentation assays into clinical decision‑making and testing salvage strategies (e.g., NK‑cell‑directed approaches or bispecifics).\n- **STK11/KEAP1‑mutant NSCLC**: Mechanistic evidence for STING silencing and DC/T‑cell exclusion aligns with clinical benefit from CTLA‑4 add‑on. This defines a true biomarker‑driven subgroup where “immune‑cold” genotypes can be re‑sensitized.\n- **KRAS‑mutant tumors**: MAPK/ERK‑driven PD‑L1 upregulation and antigen‑presentation suppression argue for rational combination of KRAS inhibitors with PD‑1 blockade, potentially with agents that restore MHC‑I (e.g., IFN pathway agonists).\n- **CIN‑high tumors**: CIN‑induced chronic STING signaling can yield immunosuppressive myeloid states. Combinations pairing ICI with agents that modulate STING, adenosine pathways (ENPP1/CD73), or myeloid checkpoints are translationally logical but remain under‑tested.\n- **TP53‑altered tumors**: Loss of miR‑34‑mediated PD‑L1 suppression and ERAP1‑dependent MHC‑I suggests therapeutic windows for PD‑1 blockade plus agents that restore antigen processing or mimic miR‑34.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Key Challenges and Knowledge Gaps**\n- **Assay harmonization**: TMB and CIN thresholds differ across platforms (tTMB vs bTMB; AI burden vs aneuploidy), limiting cross‑trial comparability.\n- **Context‑dependent immune phenotypes**: TP53 and CIN have divergent immune effects by tissue context and timing (acute vs chronic cGAS–STING), complicating biomarker‑based stratification.\n- **Antigen‑presentation escape**: High‑TMB/MSI tumors commonly acquire B2M/JAK1 defects; clinical pathways to detect and overcome these are not standardized.\n- **Checkpoint selection**: TIGIT has failed in phase 3 NSCLC trials, indicating incomplete biomarker strategy or patient selection.\n- **Prospective genotype‑stratified trials**: Aside from MSI‑H/dMMR and emerging STK11/KEAP1 data, few trials are prospectively powered for driver‑defined immune outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**V. Future Directions**\n1. **Prospective, genotype‑stratified trials**: Power studies for STK11/KEAP1, TP53, and CIN‑high cohorts with defined immune endpoints.\n2. **Integrated biomarker panels**: Combine TMB/MSI with antigen‑presentation integrity (B2M/JAK1), IFN signatures, and myeloid markers to refine ICI selection.\n3. **Mechanism‑guided combinations**:  \n   - KRAS‑mutant: KRAS inhibitor + PD‑1 + antigen‑presentation restoration (e.g., IFN pathway agonists).  \n   - CIN‑high: ICI + adenosine‑pathway blockade or STING modulators; integrate radiation where CIN suggests innate sensing.\n4. **Spatial and single‑cell TIME mapping**: Expand spatial transcriptomics across tumor types to link genotype to immune‑cell localization and functional states.\n5. **Neoantigen‑driven therapies**: Move personalized vaccines and TILs into earlier lines for high‑TMB and MSI‑H disease, with monitoring for antigen‑presentation loss.\n\n---\n\n**VI.
