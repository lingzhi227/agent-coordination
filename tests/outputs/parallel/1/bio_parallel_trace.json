ClinicalTrials.gov lists **HG202**, a Cas13 RNA‑editing therapy for neovascular AMD (SIGHT‑I, early phase 1). This underscores that Cas13 is entering the clinic, but **neurodegenerative Cas13d trials remain preclinical in the 2024–2025 literature** summarized above. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06031727?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Remaining Delivery Challenges for Neurodegenerative Indications**\n\n- **CNS distribution in large brains**: In a 2025 non‑human primate study, AAV‑PHP.eB improved cortical and spinal transduction vs AAV9 after intracerebroventricular delivery, but **subcortical penetration remained limited and peripheral leakage occurred**, highlighting persistent delivery constraints for broad CNS coverage. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41438872/))  \n- **Balancing efficacy vs collateral/off‑target activity**: High‑fidelity Cas13d variants improve specificity in C9‑ALS/FTD models, but more stringent variants can trade off on‑target potency; expression level strongly influences collateral activity. This complicates dosing and promoter design for CNS therapy. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55548-5))  \n- **Guide design for structured repeat RNAs and allele selectivity**: C9ORF72 repeats are highly structured and embedded in specific transcript variants. 2024–2025 studies show that careful guide selection can target repeat‑containing variants while sparing normal transcripts, but this remains disease‑specific and may be harder for other neurodegenerative targets. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39288267/))  \n- **Multi‑RNA targeting without expanding payload**: Dual‑targeting of sense/antisense repeat RNAs is increasingly important for C9‑ALS/FTD. Cas13d can process guide arrays, but **packing multiple guides plus regulatory elements into AAV while preserving expression control** remains a vector‑design challenge.

([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39288267/))\n\n**Key 2024–2025 Papers (Neurodegeneration + Therapeutic Enablers)**\n\n| Date (Published) | Paper | Disease/Model | Key Advance |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Sep 17, 2024** | Liu et al., *J Clin Invest* | C9ORF72 ALS/FTD; patient iPSC‑derived motor neurons; C9 repeat transgenic mice | Optimized Cas13d targeting of **G4C2 repeat RNA** (structured target), **reducing RAN translation/DPRs** in cells and mice. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39288267/)) |\n| **Jan 8, 2025** | McCallister et al., *Nat Commun* | C9‑ALS/FTD; C9‑BACexp mice; patient‑derived motor neuron‑like cells | **High‑fidelity Cas13d** reduces repeat RNA **without affecting normal C9ORF72**, lowers RNA foci and DPRs, and reverses transcriptional deficits after **AAV delivery**; improved specificity vs native enzyme. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55548-5)) |\n| **2025** | Kempthorne et al., *Nat Commun* | C9‑ALS/FTD; patient iPSC‑neurons; zebrafish; mouse models | **Dual‑targeting CasRx (Cas13d)** reduces **sense and antisense** repeat RNAs and DPRs; protects against glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity; in vivo reductions in repeat RNAs. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39779704/?utm_source=openai)) |\n| **Feb 11, 2025** | Hart et al., *Nat Biotech* | Platform/safety | Demonstrates that **collateral cleavage depends on high Cas13d expression**; low‑copy expression yields strong on‑target knockdown with less collateral activity; **high‑fidelity variants can reduce collateral but at a potency cost**. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02558-3)) |\n\n**Clinical Trials (Cas13 and Neurodegeneration)**  \nClinical translation of **Cas13 RNA editing** has begun outside neurodegeneration. ClinicalTrials.gov lists **HG202**, a Cas13 RNA‑editing therapy for neovascular AMD (SIGHT‑I, early phase 1). This underscores that Cas13 is entering the clinic, but **neurodegenerative Cas13d trials remain preclinical in the 2024–2025 literature** summarized above. ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06031727?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Remaining Delivery Challenges for Neurodegenerative Indications**\n\n- **CNS distribution in large brains**: In a 2025 non‑human primate study, AAV‑PHP.eB improved cortical and spinal transduction vs AAV9 after intracerebroventricular delivery, but **subcortical penetration remained limited and peripheral leakage occurred**, highlighting persistent delivery constraints for broad CNS coverage. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41438872/))  \n- **Balancing efficacy vs collateral/off‑target activity**: High‑fidelity Cas13d variants improve specificity in C9‑ALS/FTD models, but more stringent variants can trade off on‑target potency; expression level strongly influences collateral activity. This complicates dosing and promoter design for CNS therapy. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55548-5))  \n- **Guide design for structured repeat RNAs and allele selectivity**: C9ORF72 repeats are highly structured and embedded in specific transcript variants. 2024–2025 studies show that careful guide selection can target repeat‑containing variants while sparing normal transcripts, but this remains disease‑specific and may be harder for other neurodegenerative targets. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39288267/))  \n- **Multi‑RNA targeting without expanding payload**: Dual‑targeting of sense/antisense repeat RNAs is increasingly important for C9‑ALS/FTD. Cas13d can process guide arrays, but **packing multiple guides plus regulatory elements into AAV while preserving expression control** remains a vector‑design challenge. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55550-x?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Sources**  \n- ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39288267/))  \n- ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55548-5))  \n- ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39779704/?utm_source=openai))  \n- ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02558-3))  \n- ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06031727?utm_source=openai))  \n- ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41438872/))\n\nIf you want, I can also add a short **“what would move these approaches toward first‑in‑human neurodegenerative trials”** roadmap (capsid selection, dosing, cell‑type targeting, biomarkers, and safety assays).",

        "**Detailing p63/p73 Inhibition and Chromatin Remodeling**\n\nConformational mutants like R175H strongly inhibit tumor-suppressor functions of p63/p73 by direct binding, modulated by MDM2, while R273H shows weaker interaction, promoting invasion and metastasis (Oncogene 2015). Mutant p53 cooperates with SWI/SNF to remodel chromatin, opening key promoters (e.g., VEGFR2), with over 40% of mutant p53 target genes requiring SWI/SNF; it also upregulates epigenetic regulators MLL1/MLL2/MOZ via ETS2 interaction across R175H, R248W, and R273H mutants (Genes Dev 2015; Epigenetics & Chromatin 2025).\n\n**Summarizing Metastasis and EMT Pathways**\n\nAll three mutants enhance cell migration and invasion. R273H uniquely promotes metastasis by repressing DLX2 to upregulate NRP2 and suppressing KLF6 to activate the EGFR-AKT-FOXO1 axis; it also associates with YAP/TAZ-driven EMT signatures in colon tumors (NRP2 2017; Cell Death & Disease 2020; Epigenetics & Chromatin 2025).\n\n**Reviewing 2024-2025 Therapeutic Strategies**\n\n- Mutant-specific reactivation therapies include PC14586 (rezatapopt) targeting Y220C, with 2024 discoveries and ongoing 2025 phase II trials showing restoration of tumor suppressor function (Cancer Discovery 2025; ACS Med Chem Lett 2024).\n- Combination reactivators HO-3867 and APR-246 synergize with olaparib in p53-mutant gynecologic cancer models (Transl Oncol 2025).\n- Eprenetapopt (APR-246) phase 2 results indicate potential for reactivation and apoptosis induction (Hemasphere 2025).\n- PROTAC degraders like dp53m DNA aptamer and peptide-based P8 selectively degrade R175H mutants in preclinical studies, improving cisplatin sensitivity (Science Bulletin 2024; ACS Omega 2024).\n- Molecular glues such as bromocriptine tether p53 to USP7, stabilizing p53 but lacking mutant specificity (Science Bulletin 2024).\n- Proteasome inhibitors can degrade R273H in NSCLC cells, enhancing apoptosis, suggesting repurposing potential (Front Oncol 2024).\n\nThese approaches are mostly preclinical or early clinical and highlight varying degrees of mutant specificity and mechanism."

Mutant p53 cooperates with SWI/SNF to remodel chromatin, opening key promoters (e.g., VEGFR2), with over 40% of mutant p53 target genes requiring SWI/SNF; it also upregulates epigenetic regulators MLL1/MLL2/MOZ via ETS2 interaction across R175H, R248W, and R273H mutants (Genes Dev 2015; Epigenetics & Chromatin 2025).\n\n**Summarizing Metastasis and EMT Pathways**\n\nAll three mutants enhance cell migration and invasion.

            "text": "**Overview**  \nR175H, R248W, and R273H are classic TP53 hotspot missense mutations in the DNA‑binding domain. R175H is a conformational (structural) mutant, while R248W and R273H are DNA‑contact mutants; all three typically lose canonical sequence‑specific DNA binding and often exert dominant‑negative effects over remaining wild‑type p53, while also acquiring oncogenic gain‑of‑function (GOF) activities. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5596564/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**GOF Mechanisms (Shared and Mutation‑Biased)**  \n- **Genomic instability via DDR disruption:** Knock‑in models show R175H, R248W, and R273H share a GOF that inactivates Mre11/ATM‑dependent DNA damage signaling, producing chromosomal translocations and defective G2/M checkpoint control. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19881536/))  \n- **Transcriptional rewiring through partner TFs:** Mutant p53 proteins commonly act as transcriptional cofactors by binding other TFs (e.g., NF‑Y, ETS1/2, Sp1, SREBP) and redirecting gene programs for proliferation, survival, invasion, and metabolism. This “TF hijacking” is a dominant GOF mechanism across multiple missense mutants. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5729539/))  \n- **Suppression of p63/p73 tumor‑suppressor programs:** Conformational mutants such as R175H bind p63/p73 strongly, while contact mutants like R273H show weaker binding; MDM2 can modulate these interactions. This suppresses p63/p73‑mediated tumor suppression and promotes invasive behavior. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25417702/))  \n- **Chromatin remodeling and epigenetic co‑option:** Mutant p53 can recruit chromatin remodelers such as SWI/SNF to open promoters (e.g., VEGFR2), and a large fraction of mutp53‑regulated genes depend on SWI/SNF. In addition, hotspot mutants including R175H, R248W, and R273H can upregulate chromatin regulators (MLL1/MLL2/MOZ) by binding their promoters together with ETS2. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26080815/))  \n- **Metastasis and EMT programs (notably strong for R273H):** R273H drives metastasis by repressing DLX2 and inducing NRP2, and also promotes migration and EMT via EGFR–AKT–FOXO1‑KLF6 repression; R175H and R248W can suppress KLF6 and promote migration as well. Recent tumor‑profiling data also link R273H to YAP/TAZ‑driven EMT/partial‑EMT transcriptional states. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5596564/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n**Mutation‑Specific Emphases**  \n- **R175H (conformational):** Strong p63/p73 binding and chromatin‑driven transcriptional rewiring; shares the Mre11/ATM‑inactivation GOF and pro‑migratory programs with other hotspots. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25417702/))  \n- **R248W (contact):** Potent GOF with DNA‑damage signaling disruption and transcriptional co‑option; can suppress KLF6 and promote migration.

Mutant‑Specific Reactivation (Conformational Rescue)**  \n- **Rezatapopt (PC14586, Y220C‑specific):** 2025 Cancer Discovery reports restoration of Y220C p53 conformation and transcriptional function, with preclinical efficacy and ongoing clinical evaluation; 2024 ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters details the discovery and early clinical activity. This is the leading example of mutation‑specific reactivation, though it targets Y220C rather than R175H/R248W/R273H. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39945593/))  \n- **PYNNACLE Phase II protocol (2025):** Published trial protocol for rezatapopt monotherapy in TP53 Y220C solid tumors. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40932470/))  \n- **APR‑246 (eprenetapopt) and HO‑3867 combinations (2025):** In TP53‑mutant gynecologic cancer models, HO‑3867 and APR‑246 show strong growth inhibition; HO‑3867 is synergistic with olaparib in vitro and in vivo. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40915175/))  \n\n**2. Targeted Degradation (PROTACs reported in 2024)**  \n- **DNA aptamer‑based PROTAC (dp53m) for R175H (Science Bulletin 2024):** A mutation‑selective degrader that promotes proteasome‑dependent R175H degradation, spares WT p53, and improves cisplatin sensitivity in vitro/in vivo. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38811338/))  \n- **Peptide‑based PROTACs for R175H (ACS Omega 2024):** P8 PROTAC selectively degrades p53‑R175H in a proteasome‑dependent manner with low toxicity in cell models, including endogenous R175H contexts. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11561642/))  \n*Note:* These 2024 PROTACs are R175H‑focused and preclinical; comparable 2024–2025 PROTACs for R248W or R273H were not identified in the literature above.\n\n**3. Molecular Glues (reported in 2024)**  \n- **USP7‑engaging molecular glues (Science Bulletin 2024):** Small‑molecule glues, including bromocriptine, tether p53 to the deubiquitinase USP7, stabilizing p53 and suppressing tumor growth in xenografts. These are **not mutant‑selective**, so in GOF mutp53 tumors they may require careful context‑specific evaluation. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38734583))  \n\n**4. Destabilization Strategies (2024)**  \n- **Proteasome inhibition as a degrader for R273H (Frontiers in Oncology 2024):** In R273H NSCLC lines, proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) paradoxically trigger R273H degradation via Hsp70 and increase apoptosis, suggesting a potential repurposing strategy for select R273H contexts. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38660140/))  \n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- R175H, R248W, and R273H share core GOF mechanisms (TF hijacking, chromatin remodeling, DDR disruption), but R273H is especially linked to EMT/metastasis programs. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5729539/))  \n- The most **mutation‑specific** advanced therapeutic in 2024–2025 is Y220C‑targeted rezatapopt; comparable clinical‑stage reactivators for R175H/R248W/R273H remain limited.

([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04601-8)) As of February 19, 2026, the latest HPRC release is **Data Release 2 (May 12, 2025)**, a pre‑publication expansion to >200 individuals (232 total), providing substantially more long‑read data and assemblies than Release 1. ([humanpangenome.org](https://humanpangenome.org/hprc-data-release-2/))\n\n**How PacBio HiFi and ONT are used to build the pangenome**  \n- **PacBio HiFi** provides highly accurate long reads that form the backbone of haplotype‑resolved assemblies; Release 2 delivers ~60× HiFi coverage per sample and includes basecalling standardization (DeepConsensus) and methylation calls. ([humanpangenome.org](https://humanpangenome.org/hprc-data-release-2/))  \n- **ONT ultralong** reads (often >100 kb) complement HiFi by spanning repeats and complex loci; Release 2 targets ~30× ultralong coverage and integrates ONT with HiFi plus trio/Hi‑C phasing, yielding markedly more contiguous and structurally accurate assemblies and enabling many telomere‑to‑telomere chromosomes. ([humanpangenome.org](https://humanpangenome.org/hprc-data-release-2/))  \n- **Graph construction** from long‑read assemblies is done with multiple methods (Minigraph, Minigraph‑Cactus, PGGB), providing alternative views of homology and variation while validating SV discovery. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x))  \n\n**HPRC achievements (Release 1 → Release 2)**  \n- **Release 1 (May 2023)**: 47 phased, diploid assemblies (94 haplotypes) from diverse 1000 Genomes samples, each >99% complete and >99% accurate at structural and base‑pair levels. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x))  \n- **Draft pangenome gains**: +119 Mb of euchromatic polymorphic sequence and 1,115 gene duplications relative to GRCh38; ~90 Mb of the added sequence is structural variation. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x))  \n- **Release 2 (May 12, 2025)**: >200 individuals, 232 total genomes, multiple data types (HiFi, ONT ultralong, Hi‑C, Kinnex RNA, WGS), ~3× fewer misassemblies, more telomere‑to‑telomere chromosomes, and improved base‑level accuracy (<1 error per ~0.5 Mb). ([humanpangenome.org](https://humanpangenome.org/hprc-data-release-2/))  \n\n**Structural variant (SV) discovery enabled by long reads and pangenome graphs**  \n- Using the HPRC draft pangenome as a reference reduced small‑variant error rates by **34%** and increased SV detection **104% per haplotype** compared with GRCh38‑based workflows. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x))  \n- In rare‑disease genomes, a pangenome graph built from HiFi assemblies revealed **>200,000 SV alleles**, ~**1,000 rare coding‑impact SVs**, and enabled diagnosis‑relevant findings (e.g., a novel **KMT2E** SV). ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44980-2))  \n\n**Clinical implications**  \n- The pangenome framework directly addresses reference bias and improves gene–disease association studies across populations while expanding interpretability in repetitive and structurally complex loci. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04601-8))  \n- For rare‑disease cohorts, pangenome graphs plus long‑read assemblies enable more reproducible SV calls and prioritize rare, potentially causal SVs that are often missed by linear‑reference workflows. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44980-2))  \n- For somatic variants, early evidence from a 2026 bioRxiv preprint indicates pangenome‑guided alignment improves somatic variant calling accuracy and reduces germline contamination relative to GRCh38; this remains **pre‑peer‑review**.
